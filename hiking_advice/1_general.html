<UL>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Acquaint yourself with the area and
  its trails ahead of time so you can set a reasonable timetable.
  Many guidebooks give time estimates for trails.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">To save fuel and avoid the nuisance
  of shuttling cars, plan hikes that begin and end at the same
  parking area.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Carry more water than you think you'll
  need, as much as you can comfortably carry. Fill your canteens
  before you leave.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Backcountry water sources are unpredictable.
  Use of iodine tablets (or other suitable water purification systems)
  is advisable.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Carry more food than you think you
  will need. It's better to take extra snacks home with you than
  to go hungry on the trail.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Store your clothing and food in different
  colored sacks in your pack so you can find them easily. Put the
  items you need most frequently, such as your water bottle, guidebook
  or jacket, at the top of your pack.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Weather on the trail can change quickly,
  especially in the mountains. Layer your garments, and be prepared
  for severe weather.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">If you are driving into remote regions,
  make sure your vehicle is in good running order and top off your
  gas tank.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Start off slow to avoid fatigue partway
  through your hike. Take frequent breaks.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Let the slowest member of your group
  set the pace. If skill levels are dramatically different, break
  into groups and meet at agreed-upon locations.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">To increase your chance of seeing wildlife,
  choose less traveled trails and start your hike early in the
  morning. (When you choose less traveled trails, you also help
  reduce erosion on overused ones.)</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Leave your itinerary with someone you
  trust, and check in with them when you return.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="Anchor2"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Equipment for
a one day trip:</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Walking Boots - A good pair of walking
  boots is very advisable. Trainers are not generally suitable.
  If your footwear is unsuitable then you may be asked to do a
  less dangerous walk.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Trousers - We would prefer if you did
  NOT&nbsp;USE JEANS, for safety reasons as they get heavy when
  wet and can cause hypothermia.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Rucksack - A small rucksack or bag
  big enough to hold spare clothing, food and drink, camera, waterproofs,
  safety gear e.g. a torch. Note that carrier bags are not suitable
  (but very useful for storing stuff inside a good rucksack).</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Waterproofs - A good water proof/wind
  proof top is essential for the hill walking. Waterproof trousers
  are also advisable.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Gloves and hat - It is best if these
  are woollen and waterproof, remember it is much colder on the
  hill tops than you think.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Clothing - Lots of thin layers are
  best to trap warm air, cotton is again not a good idea because
  it traps sweat. Fleece is warm and light.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Food and Water - Onigiri, chocolate,
  dried fruit or other high energy foods.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Money - For emergencies, restaurant
  and onsen afterwards!</FONT>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="Anchor3"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Comfort</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This section is termed comfort as opposed
to safety. All matters regarding safety are dealt with in the
Safety page</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When stopped, put on an extra layer of
warm/windproof clothing, as you get cold very rapidly. Also don't
start the walk with all your clothing on - you will get hot quickly.
Carry some reserve clothing for when it gets cold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Eating carbohydrate foods beforehand
is a good idea (pasta or potatoes for example). On the mountain
eat a little, but often. Chocolate bars are a good source of energy,
giving nibbles to accompany sandwiches etc. Dried fruit is also
full of energy. Some extra food is needed as emergency rations
in case you get delayed. </FONT>.</P>

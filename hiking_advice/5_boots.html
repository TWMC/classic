<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Your enjoyment while walking rests literally on your feet.
Nothing can end a great outdoor experience quicker than painful
blisters, pinched toes or even injuries caused by inappropriate
hiking boots. (The comfort, fit and construction of appropriate
footwear can also add to your margin of safety in rugged terrain.)</P>

<P>Here is some help to help you choose the right hiking boots
for all your outdoor adventures.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>Select boots that are designed to provide the support and protection
you will need for the most difficult terrain you expect to encounter.
Before you begin shopping for a pair of hiking boots, think carefully
about what kind of hiking you plan to do.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Select boots that are designed to support the load you expect
to be carrying. The heavier your load, the more support you will
need.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Remember that great hiking boots do not have to weigh a great
deal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Once you have identified your terrain and load, consider the
various advantages of fabric versus leather boots. Fabric/leather
boots are lighter in weight and easier to break in. Many hikers
today are returning to traditional leather hiking boots for added
protection and durability in rigorous terrain. Leather boots are
supportive and water resistant yet still allow your feet to breathe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Consider the advantages of a waterproof boot. Today's top-quality
hiking boots are made with a Gore-Tex lining that lets perspiration
escape while keeping water out. Gore-Tex is more expensive, but
you can walk through puddles and shallow streams and not get your
feet wet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Note that there are four distinct types of hiking footwear,
ranging from rugged walking shoes suitable for smooth paths to
rugged mountaineering boots that carry hikers to the world's highest
peaks:</P>

<P><B>Approach Shoes</B></P>

<P>If you are hiking in a dry climate and on well-established
paths that don't have a lot of rocks, a pair of trail shoes may
be just what you need. Trail shoes are the most versatile type
of hikers and are sometimes referred to as &quot;trail shoes.&quot;
This refers to their use for getting comfortably to and from difficult
climbs.</P>

<P><B>Trail Hikers</B></P>

<P>If you are going to encounter steeper inclines, muddy paths
and need to ford small streams, then you will need some sturdier,
higher-cut waterproof boots.</P>

<P><B>Backcountry Hiking</B></P>

<P>More rugged wooded trails, brush-covered terrain and rocky
slopes. Boots can vary from all-leather and leather-and-fabric
combinations.</P>

<P><B>Mountaineering</B></P>

<P>If you plan to climb in the mountains (and might even need
to attach crampons for a better grip on glaciers or hard-packed
snow), you will want an extremely strong boot with a stiff sole
to give your ankles sturdiness and support as you climb.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Finding the Best Fit</B></P>

<P>To find the best-fitting boots, wear the socks you plan to
wear on the trail. Most suggest polyester liner socks that wick
away moisture, as well as an outer pair of heavy-weave wool or
synthetic ragg socks for cushioning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Safety Tip</B></P>

<P>On the trail, wear any kind of socks but cotton, which absorbs
water and perspiration and holds it next to your skin. If you
get into a situation where you are hiking with wet feet and the
temperature drops below freezing, you risk getting frostbite.
A good sock system and hiking boot reduce that possibility.</P>

<P>Boots should feel snug but comfortable, so you can still wiggle
your toes. Most hiking boots won't feel as instantly comfortable
as sneakers, but they shouldn't pinch, cause hot spots or constrict
circulation. They should fit securely around your ankle and instep.</P>

<P>When trying on boots, try walking down an incline. Your feet
should not slide forward, nor should your toenails scrape against
the front of your boot. If your foot slides forward, the boot
could be too wide. If the back of your heel moves around, your
boots might not be laced up tight enough.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Breaking in Your New Boots</B></P>

<P>Once you purchase a pair of boots, break them in slowly and
don't tackle Mt. Everest on your first day out. Leather boots
in particular take a while to break in, so take a couple of two-
or three-hour hikes before your big trip or wear them around the
house or even while mowing your lawn. If you find any sharp pressure
points, use boot conditioner or wax to soften the leather.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Care and Maintenance</B></P>

<P>Cleaning and waterproofing your boots from time to time is
critical. Use waterproofing on leather, and be sure to concentrate
on the seams, which can become porous over time. For boots with
a Gore-Tex? lining, use a silicon-based waterproofing treatment,
not a wax-based treatment. Wax-based treatments keep the leather
from &quot;breathing.&quot;</P>

<P>On the trail, if a blister or hot spot develops, place padding
such as moleskin or an adhesive bandage over the area. You can
cut a donut in the moleskin to create a buffer around the blister.</P>

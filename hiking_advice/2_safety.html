<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Safety Advice Page for Walking</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><BR>
Please view our safety information for walking. It may keep you
alive! A little bit of knowledge used with common sense can go
along way... </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="+2">It must also
be made aware that all walkers walk at their own risk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">We don't want safety to become a difficult
task that it stops the enjoyment we all seek from a trip into
the countryside. However it is foolish going out without some
idea of how to help prevent disasters from happening. To this
end the Club has drawn up the following Safety Guidance Policy.
This contains a list of recommendations that we hope will help
while walking in Japan.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">1. Club Interests</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">It is in the interests of Club safety that
a clear policy be established. Any member deemed acting against
Club interests as described in this policy may face appropriate
action by the Club.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">2. Equipment recommended to be carried on
any Club Hike</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">By all Members</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Waterproofs - at least a jacket/poncho, and
  preferably over-trousers. NO JEANS (as they may cause hypothermia
  when wet!).</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Good walking boots - especially if you want
  to do higher walks.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Food and water - sufficient for meals. Chocolate
  bars are good for energy.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Spare Clothes - minimum a spare jumper and
  socks.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">First aid kit.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Whistle.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Torch.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Survival Bag (light aluminium covered sheet
  to keep you warm).</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">By Leaders and Deputy Leaders.</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Map and map case, compass, whistle, first
  aid kit, torch, survival bag.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">3. Hike rules</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">All decisions on Hikes will be made by the
designated Hike Leader. Hike Leaders will be a Club Committee
member or their designated appointees. For large groups each leader
shall appoint a deputy leader to aid them. The Hikes Leader agrees
to lead hikes on the basis that their advice should be followed
as if they were in your position.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Group sizes will be kept to a maximum of about
10 during summer hikes, decreasing to about 7 on the harder winter
hikes. Larger groups can become cumbersome and dangerous. This
however will not mean people will be forced to do walks above
their ability. The minimum size will be not less than 2/3, depending
on abilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Members must consider whether they are fit
enough, competent enough and confident enough before leaving to
do a particular walk. If unsure please seek the advice of an experienced
member. If in the opinion of the Hike Leader a member is not competent,
fit or confident, then that member may be asked to find a more
suitable plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Before setting out on the Hike, the Hike Leader
must make a record of the group names and route. One copy to be
carried on the hike, the other to be left at base.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">No member may leave a group without consulting
the Hike Leader.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Stick together - try not to lag behind but
do tell the leader if the pace is too fast. The aim is to walk
at the pace of the slowest group member. If anything is bothering
you, feet hurt, pace too quick etc., please tell the other group
members and hopefully it can be sorted out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">During the winter months the hills can be more
beautiful, but with that beauty comes danger. Winter walking can
be more difficult, more dangerous and much more tiring than attempting
the same walk under different conditions. Policy regarding fitness,
competance and confidence levels is that much more important during
these months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">It must be emphasised that the Hikes Leader
is there to help your enjoyment of the countryside. He/She will
not be able to help you if you don't let them know if anything
is wrong.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">4. Travelling, Tours and Expeditions</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Travelling to and from events the driver is
in charge. His/her decisions are final and must be respected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">All the above statements concerning Hikes,
route cards, etc., apply in respect to Hikes undertaken whilst
on a Tour or an Expedition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">In case of a conflict of interests, a majority
vote of the present committee members will be called. This decision
is final and contravention of this decision is deemed against
the interests of the club.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">5.General</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Use your common sense: be aware of your environment,
check weather forecasts beforehand. If you are for any reason
in doubt or unsure - let the Hike Leader know of your concerns.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+3">Choosing a Rucksack</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This is intended for larger rucksacks (50+litres) which will
be used for backpacking - it is important you get the right rucksack
for you! Smaller rucksacks (20-45 litres) do not matter so much
as the load in the bag is a lot lighter and less crucial while
walking. Some of the below advice still applies for smaller packs
though.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>What to Look For (Internal Frame):</B></P>

<P>1. Double bottom with differentially cut inside layer - puts
weight on inside layer, significantly prolongs life of pack.</P>

<P>2. Slim profile, especially if travelling off-trail.</P>

<P>3. Straps (removable) and loops for transporting sleeping pads,
ice tools, etc.</P>

<P>4. Compression straps to enable a slim profile and stable load
and for carrying poles, wands, etc.</P>

<P>5. Load-lifter straps to pull the load off the top of your
shoulders.</P>

<P>6. A belt that cups over your hip bones, so the pack's weight
is evenly distributed over the entire belt surface and not just
on the part of the belt that rests on your hip bone.</P>

<P>7. Preferably, double zippers--in case one blows out, you won't
lose functionality.</P>

<P>8. Head clearance. You might want to look up (without hitting
your head) to see where you are going.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>Fitting a Pack</B>:</P>

<P>First, a brief word about fitting a pack. As with boots, proper
fit is the key with a backpack. The weight of a pack is secondary,
since a well-designed, heavier backpack may give you a more comfortable
ride than a much lighter pack carrying the same load.</P>

<P>NOTE: Although weight may be secondary, it is nonetheless very
important. For example, don't automatically settle for a large
(50+Litres) pack when you mostly carry 30-40 litres. Firstly,
understand your needs and how you're going to use this thing.
There are an increasing number of lightweight packs coming to
the marketplace which might serve you better.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>Know your torso length</B>.</P>

<P>Lack of this knowledge often causes an uncomfortable realization,
after the fact, that the pack doesn't fit correctly. The reason
you must measure your torso, rather than guess what size pack
you should have, based on your ability or size, can be illustrated
as follows: a large, tall person can have a short torso (and long
legs) thus requiring a smaller pack. A shorter, smaller person
can have a longer torso (and shorter legs-like me) and require
a larger pack. All pack makers design their packs with your torso
in mind. Thus, measure your torso, preferably before shopping,
so you will have that knowledge in your pocket. This will, hopefully,
eliminate total dependence on outdoor-shop salespeople, who sometimes
make mistakes !</P>

<P>The torso.</P>

<P>To determine your torso size, ask a friend or family member
to help you, if possible. You will need a tape measure or tailor's
tape to measure along your back from the seventh vertabrae--the
largest bump on the back of your neck, with your head forward--to
a point on your lower back which is hortozontal with the top of
your hipbones. If you find that your torso is on the border between
two sizes, my experience is to go with the larger size. For example,
if your torso is 18 and a small size is torso 16-18, and a medium
size is 18-20, go with the medium because you'll have more room
to make adjustments. Most good packs allow for that.</P>

<P>The rest of the fitting you will need to do, although important,
has more to do with what feels good. It seems like I'm always
getting a hipbelt or shoulder harness that feels right to me but
doesn't match with the manufacturer's fitting instructions. But
a couple of things you should look for:</P>

<P>The hipbelt should wrap around your hips, not your waist (or
stomach) and the lumbar pad should be centered properly into your
lumbar area. You want a significant amount of the pack's weight
on your hips (and, if you're like me, on the lumbar region). A
good way to do that is to make sure your hipbone is centered under
your belt (and the lumbar pad centered and pressing firmly into
you lower back).</P>

<P>Get a shoulder harness that doesn't get in the way when you
swing your arms or have buckles that pinch your skin.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>The key for any pack is to try it out with plenty of weight
in it. All outdoor shops should have weights and stuffing for
testing packs. Fill up the pack with weight approximate to that
you would be carrying on the trail. Try to distribute the weight
in the pack as best you can. After you have achieved a good fit
(and, hopefully, the salesperson concurs) take the pack for a
test drive, as follows: Bend over and touch your toes; Sway, dramatically,
from side to side; Jump up and down. Throughout these manuevers,
the pack should stick to you like glue. It should not feel sloppy,
nor, if it's properly packed, should it throw you off balance.
Walk around the store many times. Walk up and down stairs. Walk
out in the parking lot, through the nearby park, or wherever--assuming
it's okay with the salesperson. Take the pack off, loosen all
the straps, put the pack back on, tighten all the straps, and
walk around some more.</P>

<P>Concentrate on ensuring yourself that the weight is being distributed
evenly. You shouldn't feel excess weight in any one spot, unless
of course you want it that way. A good pack will provide flexibility
to shift the weight around via adjustments. Fiddle around with
the adjustments. Shift weight to your shoulders, then to your
hips. Each should feel comfortable, because on the trail you will
use different adjustments going uphill than you will downhill.
Also, when your shoulders get tired on a long haul, you may want
to shift more weight to your lower back and hips. Experiment!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Once you've decided on purchasing a pack, ask if you can return
the pack, if upon further testing and experimenting at home with
your own gear loaded in it, you decide it's not the right pack,
after all. Note. Marmot allow you to purchase it, then take it
home and try it out with your gear or whatever--keeping it clean,
of course--so you can have time to decide if it really is the
pack for you. If the pack has inter-changeable parts, Marmot will
allow you to bring back parts for exchange--if you don't like
the way the hipbelt is wrapping around you, take it back and exchange
it. Look for that kind of professional support because it makes
finding the right gear a whole lot easier.</P>

<P><B>Packing Tips</B>:</P>

<P>Unless you have a bomb-proof, leak-proof pack, organize gear
in waterproof stuff sacks or heavy duty zip-loc freezer bags.
Color-coded stuff sacks make it easy to locate gear items and
is an especially useful way of keeping track of smaller items.
Another option is to put a large heavy-duty garbage sack into
your pack bag as a liner to ensure everything is protected (this
is probably the lightest approach for keeping gear dry but doesn't
provide for good gear organization).</P>

<P>Pack a tent on top where you can get to it fast in a sudden
storm without pulling out any of the rest of your gear. Also,
pack items such as raingear, water, snacks, sunscreen/sunglasses,
camera, and other quick access gear items, in an easily accessible
location - e.g. right next to side zips, in the pack lid pocket,
a side pocket, or on top of the pack, along with the tent.</P>

<P>If your pack doesn't have a framesheet between you and your
gear, make sure you pack sharp and hard objects away from your
back, preferably toward the outside of the pack, e.g. items like
stove, cook pots, water &amp; fuel bottles, and tent poles &amp;
pegs.</P>

<P>If your pack doesn't have a bottom compartment for your sleeping
bag, and if you are on the trail for extended periods, you might
want to consider putting your sleeping bag up toward the top of
your pack. Putting your bag at the bottom with all the rest of
your gear on top of it won't help the bags lofting ability.</P>

<P>Keep fuel containers away from food and cooking gear. Place
fuel containers in heavy duty gallon bags and pack upright.</P>

<P>Strive for a horizontal distribution of weight, so that one
side of the pack isn't heavier than the other. You should keep
the weight centered so that you don't lose your balance or hurt
your back.</P>

<P>Slimmer is better. Make sure the compression straps are tight
after packing to help ensure a slim pack profile. Remember, the
fatter your pack becomes, the farther you must lean forward to
bring the pack's center of gravity back over your hips - fat packs
can result in sore backs !</P>

<P>If mainly on the trail, especially for long distance treks,
pack the heavier items in the upper portion of the pack, in order
to create a higher center of gravity. This centers the pack weight
above your body where it's easier to carry (on easy to moderate
tread).</P>

<P>If going off trail, pack heavier items close to the back in
the middle portion of the pack. This will result in better stability
when boulder hopping, post-holing, or whatever.</P>

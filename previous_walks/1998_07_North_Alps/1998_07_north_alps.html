<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">July 21, TSUKUBA, JAPAN (Rooters) In a hastily
called press conference, Tsukuba Walking and Mountaineering Club
acting secretary John S. Payne announced today that their previous
press release of Thursday, July 16 was not entirely accurate.
In that press release, the TWMC announced that one of their members,
Victor Heese, had died while hiking on a TWMC sponsored walk in
the North Alps, Nagano prefecture, on the weekend of July 18-20.
In this latest press release, the TWMC retracted their previous
statement and said that Mr. Heese, much to their surprise, had
not in fact died.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When asked why the TWMC had made such an outrageous
and obviously premature statement, Payne replied that although
Heese had gone on a few previous walks with the club, he was in
no way prepared for such a strenuous trip. &quot;In the minds
of the TWMC executive, this time Victor had bitten off more than
he could chew and we felt it was in everyone's interest to declare
what we considered to be a foregone conclusion,&quot; said Payne.
When asked how this could possibly be in everyone's interest Payne
stated that &quot;As Monday was a holiday and we didn't think
that Victor would make it through the first 2 days of the trip,
we could hold an early wake at Victor's favourite hangout, the
Gold Rush, to commemorate his noble but disastrous effort. We
figured, given Victor's love of a good party, that would be what
he would have wanted. We never imagined that the old fart was
going to make it.&quot; When asked if the TWMC was the kind of
club that gave its members special nicknames and if &quot;old
fart&quot; was Heese's, Payne responded &quot;Not really. That's
what we call him behind his back. But we mean it affectionately.
No, really!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Club treasurer, Paul Reay, added that given
Heese's vices and that his emergency medical kit consisted of
a half liter of 'medicinal' scotch and a pack of Marlboros, he
could have gone at any time of heart failure, respiratory disease,
liver dysfunction or terminal baldness, but that probability suggested
that it would be this weekend. He continued, &quot;Personally,
I had the old fart down for syphilis on the 18th. I mean that
affectionately. Really!&quot; When asked to elaborate, Reay refused
comment but it has been learned from anonymous sources that the
TWMC had created a pool in which members guessed the date and
means of Heese's death with the winner to receive Heese's new
backpack and 2 free future walks. Sources also claim that life
insurance had been taken out on Heese by the TWMC. When asked
to confirm this, Reay refused comment but did admit that the TWMC
had in fact been looking to purchase new medical supplies and
a tent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Further investigation has determined that the
TWMC had planned a 'walk' in the mountains of Nagano and that
9 members had gone. Four members, 3 women and 1 man, took a North
to South route from Nakabusa Spa rendezvousing with the second
group at Yarigatake on the second night of the trip. The second
group, consisting of 5 male members including Heese, took a more
difficult route starting from Kamikochi that included climbing
Okuhotaka-dake (Japan's 3rd highest mountain) and Yarigadake (Japan's
4th highest mountain) as well as 5 other peaks. Though inexperienced,
Heese seems to have survived this difficult trek.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Although this second route was significantly
more dangerous than the first, which was much more appropriate
for an inexperienced hiker, sources say that Heese joined the
more difficult hike and even began to gleefully sing the Village
People song &quot;Macho Man&quot; as he signed his name and gave
his blood type and dental records to organizers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When reached for comment, members of the second
group were unanimously surprised. Andreas said, &quot;Although
he was not as sure-footed as a mountain goat, the old fart made
up for it by by being as grumpy as a billy goat. That is said
affectionately. Really!&quot; Negishi-san commented &quot;He part
Japanese must be. The old fart ga went to climbing with stubborn
endurance and suffering. Affectionately that I mean. Honto ni!&quot;
David stated, &quot;Tabernacle! Le viellieux fart did not seem
to mind even when ze little old grannies passed him. I mean zat
affectionnment. Vraiment!&quot; The only apparent dissent came
from Thomas who said, &quot;I should have joined the women's group.
It was no fun sleeping beside the old fart. But of course, I mean
that affectionately. No. I'm serious.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Members of the other group were also contacted
for their comments. Sylvie said, &quot; Asti! I could not believe
my eyes when I saw him walking to the lodge at Yarigadake! Zough
I had only met him ze night before last, I was sure that I would
not see ze old fart again. I must say zat affectionately because
I do not really know him. Really!&quot; Miho-san, out of politeness
refused all comment, although she did admit to thinking that she
was seeing a ghost as Heese approached the lodge. Franz also seemed
surprised at Heese's appearance. &quot;Gott im Himmel! I chose
das easy route because I remember Oze and I did not vant to carry
das alte fart's body down za mountain. But I mean dat with affection.&quot;
Laure recounted how when Heese reached the summit of Yarigatake
everyone broke into applause causing a rockslide that killed 3
Japanese and 1 American climber. &quot;I'm sure the Japanese will
be missed,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Heese was unavailable for comment, however
his doctor did say that had Heese been conscious, it might have
been appropriate to use Mark Twain's famous quote upon hearing
of the premature announcement of his own death. &quot;But, he's
probably not that clever, even when he is conscious,&quot; the
doctor continued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Also at the hospital was Heese's brother, Jon
Heese. He commented that &quot;My brother's breathing seems a
little less desperate now that we have him on the ventilator.
The scotch IV drip also seems to be making a difference.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Although family and friends were initially
upset at the TWMC's premature death announcement, plans for a
defamation of character lawsuit have been dropped as it was discovered,
upon careful examination, that Heese doesn't actually have a character....</FONT></P>

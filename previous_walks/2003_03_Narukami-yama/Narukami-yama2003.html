Narukami-yama is located 103 km northwest of Tsukuba in the city of 
Kiryu.  We started our journey at 6:00 am. On the way the nice view 
of Fuji-san cheered us and as means Sunday turns to be really a sunny 
day. We were so courageous that the wild boar hunting on our trails 
and bear in the forest doesn't make us sad and we were determined to 
climb the mountain. Yea!! I remember, some of us want an encounter 
with the wild animals (but alas or fortunate) and was talking about 
the taste of the wild boar meat. At some places the leaves of the 
trees were fighting against the sunrays and restricted its entrance.  
All of us enjoyed hiking, walking through the thick forest, snowing 
at the top of the mountain, slippery ice trails and also waterfalls 
at the finishing point. Here are some pictures. Cheers!

<H3><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">A trip to Nikko [my, Iulias,
point of view]</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
Motto: &quot;Fluffy and laughing make any situation enjoyable&quot;.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">The weather forecast for the rainy season
cannot be good. But Terry said &quot;rain or shine&quot; and a
simple member of the club cannot argue with his president. <BR>
Anyway, Saturday morning is was &quot;shine&quot; and 9 people
gathered around three cars near 7/11. A &quot;heart breaking&quot;
decision for Shinji was taken, we would drive with two cars and
the GPS equipped, silver sports [looking] car would stay in Tsukuba.
Well, we had some road atlases, maps, a smaller GPS and Terry's
confidence that we will find the way. Apparently in the other
car (Mario's) the confidence was not entirely shared: when Terry
drove first toward the AIST (to let Shinji's car in the AIST parking),
Mario drove in the opposite direction, toward Mt. Tsukuba. Afraid
of an open mutiny, the people in his car forced him to stop and
wait for Terry. <BR>
Reunited we reached Nikko, passed Nikko and entered the famous
windy road leading to Chuzenji lake. Well, even concentrating
on saying the poem related to this road, Shinji did not feel comfortable
about &quot;sitting in the car&quot; and not &quot;driving the
car&quot;. I was really thankful I didn't have to drive. The scenery
was beautiful; Sun was still with us, we had plenty of time...
Dropped out near the Ryuzunotaki (waterfall) we spent the time
in which Terry and Mario drove off to leave one car at the end
point of the first day's walk by taking pictures (very nice waterfall,
funny participants and a new star was born: Fluffy) and supporting
the Japanese economy with omiyage shopping. Elena and I checked
out the geta; unfortunately they were suitable for the delicate
Japanese feet only.<BR>
Half an hour later we were on the way toward Senzyogahara marsh.
Some more water falls, nice water games around spectacular boulders
in the river, some naked, some covered with fluffy green moss.
The walk went through a beautiful forest along the river, with
bamboo grass and dead tree trunks resembling to fantastic creatures.
The image of a couple sitting and doing aquarelles of the landscape
reminded me the impressionists and the strong influence the Japanese
paintings had... Well, this is another story. <BR>
Strolling we did not pay attention to the real world and woke
up on the opposite river bank but near the starting point of our
walk. I don't know about the others but I enjoyed walking that
small part twice, prolonging the sentiment of silence and beauty.
The marsh itself was a little bit more populated with tourists
&shy; I think there was a kind of contest &shy; and for a while
we were busy &quot;konichiwa&quot;- &quot;hi&quot;- and &quot;byebye&quot;-ing.<BR>
Japanese children are dangerous! Dangerously attractive I mean.
For Angie, coming from Brazil and encountering a lot of &quot;premieres&quot;:
1st time with the TWMC, 1st time around Nikko, this was the first
time when she noticed the danger, but too late. Thus, it was also
the first time she twisted her left ankle.<BR>
I think that the first day we shot a lot of pictures, of marsh
with fog, dried roots, strange fluffy wigs and a crocodile. Why?
Don't you believe this? Look at the pictures.</FONT></H3>

of that day. The anglers in the lake above partially lost in the
fog also. The day ended with another windy road until the Mebuchizawa-onsen
where our minshyuku was located. During dinner Kouichi arrived.
Well, actually the day did not end here. Stephan had his birthday
celebrated with champagne, beer, snacks and plenty of talk.</FONT></H3>

The second day also begun sunny, we reached first an attractive
onsen &shy; Nikkozawa, wooden houses, view of a waterfall and
a fluffy dog &shy; we paused, dreamed of trying it after the hike
and went further. The steep part of the hike had no major incidents,
if one doesn't count me and Mario being slow and Terry watching
us. The Okukinu marsh was not much too see partially due to the
cold weather the flowers were shy to show themselves and then
there was the thunderstorm and rain starting as if ordered, just
when we started to enjoy the view. Lucky the ones who managed
(or were intelligent enough) to put on their entire rain gear!
We had everything: rain, hail, thunder, ponds to cross and the
trail was partially a creek. We discovered that the waterproof
quality of our gear refers to &quot;once water enters it will
be kept safe inside&quot;. This applies to walking boots, rucksack
covers and the pockets of rain jackets. The rucksack covers Shinji
and me had have two tiny holes for aeration; the water accumulated
at the bottom &shy; and not yet sucked in the rucksack &shy; reached
at a certain point the holes in my cover and made someone behind
me say that it seems like I'm incontinent. It did not matter.
I also discovered a new method for money laundry: put your wallet
in the pocket of your rain jacket! The problem with these &quot;clean&quot;
banknotes is that they are not accepted in the vending machines
while still wet!</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
Since our dry clothes were in the car trunks we decided that the
beautiful onsen with waterfall view will remain for the time being
only a dream. Well, later on the way Sun appeared again &shy;
bloody coward &shy; not strong enough to dry us but warm enough
to feed our good mood. Did I say that apart from some time when
we were to concentrated on slipping only on our buts and not on
the person in front of us, there were jokes, laughing (of course
at ourselves), whistling (Ayho! Ayho! ... dwarf's song from Snow-white)
and generally a not so bad mood. <BR>
Kouichi, Angie and Chisa left earlier. Pity for them. The onsen
and dinner we had after were very nice. To the onsen we took another
windy route. The onsen for girls was a gift only for Elena and
me. We wanted to take a picture of the outside pool but had no
camera. I wondered if Shinji would use his. He did. Even if their
bath was a little crowded they managed to scare everybody out
and take a picture of the Nikko-group/males. There were no major
complaints apart from Renato (water too hot, I cannot quote him
because the lines will be for sure censored). Even Elena said
that she is &quot;totally satisfied [with the walk]&quot; &shy;
unfortunately you have to believe my words, I could not record
her.<BR>
A huge &quot;THANK YOU&quot; Terry for giving us these two wonderful
days!</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Aftermath: the rain covers Chisa and Elena
had proved successful enough that now it became a &quot;must&quot;.
Renato &shy; being a good example of my idea that &quot;the amount
if hair people have is nearly identical but differently distributed'
&shy; got the nickname &quot;Fluffy&quot;. Shinji believes about
himself and the boys that they are &quot;sexy&quot; &shy; Elena
and me had no camera in the onsen. Stephan is one year older.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Statistics related to the walk (Elena's
late hobby): 10 participants from 6 countries (Japan*4, Brazil*2,
Bulgaria, Germany, Romania and Russia each with one participant);
six boys (or men: Kouichi, Mario, Renato, Shinji, Stephan, Terry)
and four girls (or women: Angie, Chisa, Elena, Iulia); five people
wearing glasses... I think I will stop here. <BR>

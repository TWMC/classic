	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">We had announced that the Nyoho-san

&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">We left Tsukuba on Saturday 
	morning around 7:10 (7:40 at KEK) than met one of us at a station near Nikko 
	around 10:00.</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">After a (small) car problem we 
	finally reached Nikko around 11:30 and started hiking around 12:00 (after 
	visiting the shrine dedicated to </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">the famous Sake waterfall near 
	the start of our hike). We paid a visit to the shrine dedicated to the 
	travellers at the foot of </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">Nyoho-san and then we 
	(Alexander, Daniel, Sveta and Nicolas) started climbing.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">The first day was fine and we 
	started with a relatively good pace, faster than the map time, but after a 
	few hours we became slower... </font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">After a day during which we had 
	almost meet nobody we could have expected to be alone at the emergency hut, 
	but in fact it was already packed and we</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">hardly found 4 spots to sleep... 
	We considered camping around the hut but we found no suitable place (the 
	area of the hut is very rocky).</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">The water point that was 
	supposed to be near the hut was in fact 10 minutes away, down a steep path! 
	One of us went to get water before the </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">dinner and two of us had to go 
	in the dark after dinner! We went to bed around 20:30 tired by the 1700 
	meter that we had climb during that first day.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">Some of us had a very nice sleep 
	during the night while some other spent the night listening the concerto of 
	the many snorer that were in the hut...</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">The next morning we woke up at 
	3:30 (yes, 3:30 on a Sunday morning!!!) very surprised to see that none of 
	the Japaneses who were in the hut had </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">already rushed to the summit to 
	enjoy the sunrise.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">The last 100m (vertical ascent) 
	that separated us from the summit of Nyoho-san were not so easy and it took 
	us one hour to reach the summit</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">(instead of 40 minutes map 
	time). Even if we arrived too late for the sunrise, we enjoyed very fine 
	views from the summit of Nyoho-san (243m).</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">After a cup of tea and a few 
	biscuits for breakfast, we walked down to the famous &quot;Fuji-view pass&quot;. On 
	the way Alexander found a (small) patch of</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">snow to refresh his feet. The 
	pass itself was rather disappointing as it is a saddle surrounded by trees 
	(and thus there is no view on mount Fuji</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">or even on Nyoho-san and Nantai-san!).</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">There we decided to split the 
	group into two parts: Daniel and Nicolas decided to climb Komanago-san 
	(2323) and Omanago-san (2375) while </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">Alexander and Sveta took a 
	bypass to go directly to the foot of Nantai-san.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">The ascent of Komanago-san is 
	very steep and rocky while to climb Omanago-san one follows a path accross 
	the forest. The trail going down </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">from Omanago-san to Nantai-san 
	has some passes with chains and ladders (but nothing terrible).</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">On the bypass Alexander and 
	Sveta walked about 10 minutes and then saw 2 roads splitting. There they met 
	a Japanese person, who was also wondering</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">which way to take. He checked 
	his GPS and suggested a way. They decided to follow him even if after 
	checking the map they were not sure that was a </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">good way. It was a way of a 
	river with dams and many big and small stones, hard to walk but interesting. 
	Once they even had to use a rope to go dawn. </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">It took them 2 hours and then we 
	had to climb a bit to reach a road leading to the foot of Nantai-san. They 
	lost a lot of time in that </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">riverbed and the Japanese man 
	felt sorry and gave them a ride in his car to the foot of Nantai-san once 
	they reached the road.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">Sveta waited for Nicolas and 
	Daniel on her way to the summit of Nantai-san while Alexander went directly 
	to the car.</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">We all started climbing around 
	noon and soon we realized what everybody has read in the news on Monday: the 
	rainy season was in advance and had </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">just started!</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">It started with a thin rain but 
	at the summit of Nantai-san (2485) it was a chilly rain with a cold wind, 
	thus we rushed to a shelter near the</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">shrine were we ate a snack. The 
	descent to lake chuzenji was also very rocky in its first part and muddy and 
	slippery at the end. We were well</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">beyond the map time (it took us 
	4 hours instead of 2h35). We reached the lake around 18:45. Then we took a 
	bus to go back to Nikko.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">During that time Alexander had 
	walked back along the road from Chuzenji to Nikko and we met him in the 
	shrines of the ancient Nikko not very far from </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">the car!</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">We have hiked 14 hours the 
	second day and a total of 21 hours over the week-end, so we were rather 
	tired! Some of us have climbed more than 3000m </font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">(total vertical ascent) with a 
	backpack weighting more than 16kg!</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">If you want to check how fit you 
	are, I recommend you to give a try to this hike!</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">A few things to know for those 
	planning to do this hike in the coming years<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">-&gt; Chlorine or iodine pills can 
	help even if the water is supposed to be &quot;pure&quot; near the hut (some of us had 
	stomach problems after drinking the water)<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">-&gt; Filter are not necessary as 
	the water comes out from a pipe<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">-&gt; Tents might not be necessary 
	as Nyoho-san is very rocky (and thus sleeping under a tent would be very 
	uncomfortable) but the hut can be crowded.<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">-&gt; The lightest you sleeping bag 
	is, the better it is, especially in the rocky parts</font></div>

					I am happy to report that we came back 
					from Kasama with joyful (and sleepy?) mood. 20 people and 7 cars appeared to the meeting place, so we 
					had enough seats for everyone at the end. All the participants completed the hike happily 
					(actually it was more than 20 people if we include the
					unborn baby in its tough and cheerful 
					mother ;)</font></div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="4"><br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
					<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="4">Surprisingly, many kinds of flowers were 
					blooming. We saw cherry, azalea, pear, lily, katakuri! etc. We also encountered many animals such as 
					tadpoles, snakes, lizards! Weather kept smiling all 
					the time. We could enjoy both walk and nap 
					comfortably under blue sky, and could contribute bending
					machines at the end of the hike by buying 
					a lot of cold drinks.</font></div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="4"><br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
					<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="4">I am not sure if all the participants 
					enjoyed Kasama pottery fair as well as we did with the hike. We could spend only one hour which was 
					not enough to examine all the stalls.&nbsp; Some three snowcone lovers could not even manage to visit the 
					site at all.&nbsp; Well, I hope the trip served its introductory role of Kasama pottery to 
					the most of the new comers at least.</font></div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="4"><br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
					<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="4">Although we are quite a big group 
					consisted of variety of members, people were so cooperative 
					and friendly, making everything smooth. I 
					thank all the participants for crating such an enjoyable 
					trip, and drivers for making the trip possible. 
					Special thanks goes to Ryoko who suggested me such a nice destination and helping me all the 
					leading work!!!</font></div>&nbsp;</div>

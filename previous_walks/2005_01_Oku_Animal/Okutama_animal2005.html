				hikes and was an attempt to approach nature with the combination 
				of animal tracking and hiking. It also meant to improve the 
				sense and response of hikers in mountains. We thank all the 
				participants for the kind cooperation during the event.</font></div>
			<div>
				<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">
				<br>
				I (Ajay) couldn't participate in this event because Tsukuba 
				Medical Center Dr. Nishi (I forget his name..) didn't allow me 
				to climb mountains. So I am sorry that the participants of the 
				hike couldn't track one of the biggest animals in TWMC :).</font></div>
			<div>
				<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">I am writing this report&nbsp; from the information I got from 
				Ryoko. She feels that all the participants of this hike much 
				improved in tracking animals. So next time near your place if u 
				find any animal footprints and would like to find which animal 
				it is, don't forget that animal tracking experts are around u 
				:).</font></div>

&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">The day started earlier than usual. The weather forecast for the 
				day was sunny and in the morning temperature was less than 5 
				degrees. As decided, reached the 7-11 at 5: 10 am. For this hike 
				there were a total of 7 participants, 6 from Tsukuba and one 
				from Tokyo. We planned to catch the 5:54 train from 
				Hitachinoushikku, so we rushed to the station. Every thing went 
				fine as planned. We could meet the participant from Tokyo in the 
				train; reached the Okutama station around 9:15. A pick-up van 
				was already there. It took us up to the visitor center, where 
				the animal-tracking program was arranged.&nbsp; Animal tracking 
				sensei Sachi was quite expert in this field and explained 
				everything. She first started describing about the location and 
				kind of animals around the area. It is not easy to meet the 
				animals, but if we try to see field signs such as footprints, 
				droppings as well as leftover, they could be visible.&nbsp; We 
				started to walk towards the lake, suddenly we found animal 
				footprints in the direction of lake from the mountain. When we 
				closely observe it, we understood that it was a deer's footprint 
				and near the lake the leaves in the trees were all eaten up to 
				the height of the animal.&nbsp; In this program we learnt the basic 
				aspects of animal tracking. After this program we had lunch at 
				the visitor center and after the lunch again started walking to 
				the ridge trails near yama-no- furusatomura . This valley was 
				behind the mountain so it became dark around 3 pm itself, so we 
				decided to go back to the visitor center. At the visitor center 
				luckily we found an activity called mayudama tsukuri!, a 
				traditional Japanese program of making colored rice balls and 
				decorating the tree. After decorating the tree, we checked into 
				the bungalow. The person from the visitor center told us that it 
				is possible to see flying squirrel from a place near the bridge. 
				Some of us waited there, and found some black thing flying in a 
				flash of a second; looked like flying squirrel. The Bungalow was 
				gorgeous, a big hall and kitchen; we prepared the dinner, Korean 
				hot chilly noodle and Japanese Udon, and also planned for the 
				next day.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">23rd January 2003</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">The plan was to wake up at 7 am and start cooking the breakfast. 
				But other members prefered sleeping in the cold morning so the 
				arranging of breakfast also became organizer's duty. We had 
				breakfast and, as planned, headed towards Mito-san. There was 
				heavy snow on the way and was very difficult to imagine how deep 
				it is. The landscape covered with snow was very beautiful. On 
				the trails many times we were trapped in the snow not knowing 
				which way to go. We could see the footprints of animals in many 
				locations and we tried to imagine what kind of animal it could 
				be and also could see wild squirrels in</font></div>
			<div>
				<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">front of us.&nbsp; Suddenly some of us noticed blood in the snow; our 
				detective mind started working. We found some footprints of 
				animals near the place and some hair. So everyone seemed to come 
				up with a conclusion that a rabbit might have been attacked, or 
				maybe a bird (but not sure). we followed the footprints and 
				again we saw blood. From the faces of some of the members, I got 
				a feeling that it was very cold and to go back. After the 
				adventurous hike in the snow and animal tracking we planned to 
				enjoy onsen. Actually we decided to enjoy onsen for one hour to 
				be able to catch the rapid train to Tokyo. But some of the 
				members were more interested in the onsen and because of that we 
				split the groups into two and the first group reached Tsukuba 
				around 8 pm. </font> </div>

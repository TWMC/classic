			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#CC0000">I am happy to report that the first 
			family walk of the club has been successful enough for us to think 
			of organizing some more. Although families have always been 
			encouraged to join our walks, we organized this one especially to 
			encourage children and their parents to join, so that the children 
			can learn to appreciate and enjoy nature. The study of nature 
			actually bordered on academic by introduction of Sumi-e art to the 
			walk. Participants, including children, studied plants and flowers 
			closely to draw them. </font></b></div>

			<b>
			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#CC0000"><br>
			We were 19 adults and 7 children (aged 2 to 11) (8 families). All 
			this not counting the one still unborn, and not counting Ginny and 
			Tadashi who gave a brief appearance.</font></b></div>

			worrying with chances of rain in the afternoon, but we were lucky 
			and there was in fact more than two hours of diffused sunshine, 
			after threatening clouds which gathered at about noon. Everyone made 
			it without difficulty. Children were the most active. A 5-year old 
			was heard complaining to his father that he was just walking, while 
			he had been promised a hike!</font></b></div>

			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#CC0000">We climbed from the northern side (with 
			gentler slopes) and climbed down on the south which has choice of 
			many trails. We had parked cars at both ends. Sakura trees in bloom 
			dotted the hillsides. We stopped at Expo memorial near the top for 
			lunch and Sumi-e. Everyone tried and enjoyed the art.</font></b></div>

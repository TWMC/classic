Kamikochi 2001 - the year of helicopter!<BR>
Hi,<BR>
Just a quick mail to let you know that everyone (the 'hards' -
Lester, Chisa, Kouichi and Ilya, and the 'easies' - Victor, Terry,
Tadashi, Stefan (Recksiegel) and myself) got back from Kamikochi
safely. We had superb weather, and views that I will remember
for a very long time. This year, the 'easies' were attempting
a long, circular walk from Kamikochi, and not the the one I had
advertised on the list. Every Club walk appears to have its associated
stories these days. These are the highlights of Kamikochi 2001:<BR>
1) I exhausted my companions on the first day, who decided to
take the escape route on the second to Nakabusa Onsen, leaving
me to walk alone to meet the others at Yari-ga-take.<BR>
2) We had a little nervous wait for Chisa and Ilya at the hut
on the second night. The queue was so long to climb Yari (4 hours,
when it should take only 1), they didn't get to the hut until
8:10 pm.<BR>
3) We lost Lester coming down from Yari on the final day. I did
a 'Masako', and went looking for him, but there was no sign of
him at the place of his last reported sighting. He had somehow
managed to walk straight passed us at a rest stop, and we didn't
see him again until Kamikochi.<BR>
4) Terry lost his wallet on the bus from Nakabusa.<BR>
AND... wait for it...<BR>
5) A CLUB FIRST - STEFAN HAD TO MAKE USE OF THE HELICOPTER SERVICE
ON THE FINAL DAY. <BR>
Not a Club first, he was having knee problems, later diagnosed
as acute arthritis.<BR>
If you want to hear more, come along to the meeting on Wednesday.<BR>
Many thanks to the people who came along this year, particularly
the car owners and drivers.<BR>
I find it quite amusing that this year, Kamikochi will be remembered
more for the 'easy' walk! Shouldn't smile, but: :-)))<BR>

Kamikochi 2001 - big thankyou!</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Dear All,<BR>
This note is to thank the TWMC for its existence and for arranging
this trip which turned out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event. <BR>
As I mentioned already, I don't know how I can come to any more
walks now. So perfect was this one. Everything was there: mountains
of such beauty that cannot be imagined, thrilling climbs, miraculous
weather without a single cloud and, last but not least, brilliant
people. I cannot think of any other walk that could match this.
<BR>
I would like to give my special thanks to people who contributed
to making the trip so memorable.<BR>
First and foremost - to Chisa who walked with me for most of the
time and climbed with me through the difficult parts. Chisa, your
company certainly made the mountains look even more beautiful.<BR>
To Paul who put so much of his heart and thought into arranging
everything and pushed himself hard to complete the two 11-hour
walks on the first two days to meet us at the hut. Paul, when
I finally saw you on the second day I knew everything would be
fine. Thanks also for introducing me to the onsen!<BR>
To Stefan whose fleece was so nice and warm and proved to be absolutely
essential at the tops of those ridges.<BR>
To Tadashi for entrusting his nice van into my hands.<BR>
Some Highlights.<BR>
The most terrifying memory <BR>
Reading Paul's account of the 2000 trip. The bit where Paul describes
the Cole makes your hart pound so hard you don't want to come
anywhere near this. Ironically, in reality, Chisa and I simply
missed the hardest point thinking that it was still ahead of us.
Yes, the Cole was difficult, especially a couple of areas with
very smooth rock at the top and nothing to hold on to. However,
since we thought the worst was yet to come, we simply could not
afford to get frightened and just made sure every step was to
preserve our life not to loose it. It was only at Minami-dake
that it became clear the worst was over. Perhaps it worked out
for the best. <BR>
I would like to encourage those who may have this opportunity
to consider this route for next year. You can do it. By the time
the difficulty approaches, your mind gets so used to the heights
it stops bothering you completely. The danger really awaits you
at simpler bits where you inadvertently allow your concentration
to relax and also, and most of all, it comes from other people
whom you will have to pass and then one wrong movement on their
part or yours means death.<BR>
The most dangerous bit<BR>
The summit of Yariga-Take. The queue to get there was nearly 4
hours. People in the queue exercised surprising patience and order
while waiting but, when we finally got up there, it was almost
dark and very windy and the people seemed to have lost all their
patience moving erratically on the overcouded summit, all wanting
to get a photo opportunity near the plague which said 3180m. <BR>
The worst memory<BR>
Sharing the tatami with Les on the first night. As fine a person
as he is, Les turned out to have a habit of turning over to his
side and pulling the blanket over with him. This, combined with
very long legs, sleeping like a baby and thus not responding to
kicks, forced me into space so small it can only be compared with
the area on Ginza street I can afford and also using the blanket
of a Japanese person lying nearby. Hope this is the first and
the last time in my life I am in bed with a man.<BR>
Cheers to all - Ilya</FONT></H3>

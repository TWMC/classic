			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#600000">Well Drasta and myself had a wonderful 
			time with about 8 other happy campers with the Japanese Fly Fishing 
			Association on their first sojourn into being professional fly 
			fishing guides. I am sure we were an interestinggroup for them to practice on as were 
			all total beginners! I had been wanting to fly fish for some time 
			now was very pleased when Ajay and Ryoko announced this trip to 
			Minami Aizu in Fukushima prefecture.</font></b></div>
&nbsp;<div>
			<b>
			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#600000">Before our first session of fly fishing 
			we made camp, then geared up- in huge waders. We began the lesson in 
			a relatively wide river near a bridge where we practiced the 
			beginning basics of how to tie surgeons and clinchknots, how to wade a stream and how to 
			cast. There were many instructors so that most of us received 
			individual attention I was initially a bit intimidated by my silent 
			instructor but he turned out to be a gem and was extremely patient 
			and full of love for the art of fly fishing (I hardly dare call it a 
			sport). We were given a demonstration of Japanese style fly fishing 
			also which evolved concurrently but independently of the European 
			style. 3 fish were caught that day in total!</font></b></div>
&nbsp;<div>
			<b>
			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#600000">That night we spent at the camp site 
			with a great BBQ and a Daal made by Ajay provided. There was also 
			some impromptu fish education with Yamame (lady in the mountain) and 
			Iwana ( rock fish ) photos shown. The next morning, after a night of heavy rain ,we 
			started out late but it was still a very fulfilling&nbsp; morning of fly 
			fishing and wading up&nbsp; a very beautiful stream. Our guide also cut 
			some plants form the side of the river which we ate - Udo- which he 
			said was also very good for tempura. He also dug form rocks on the 
			river bed and showed us various stages of insect life. I became very 
			aware of the insect life around me and their different colors and 
			shapes. As the day progressed and the sun began to shine a myriad of 
			colors reflected on the waters surface and though I did not see the 
			elusive Yamame I could imagine its beauty lying somewhere not too 
			far away.</font></b></div>
&nbsp;<div>
			<b>
			<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#600000">In the feedback session the casting of 
			fly fishing was compared to the actions of sumie. I too became aware 
			of something refined in this experience so that my natural 
			Australian love and at-homeness with nature was somehowtransformed into a feeling of&nbsp; unity!&nbsp; 
			This was truly yet another highlight in my time here in Japan that 
			the love and care of TWMC has again given me.</font></b></div>

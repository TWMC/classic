&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">This time tmwc adds another record for its history - a night of earthquakes
	in a shaking mountain hut! Anyway that would come later.
	First lets congratulate&nbsp; Ryoko and Ajay for such a good organization not
	only of the walk but also of the photo-contest. It was fun.
	If you are interested in only looking at the pictures, the link is given at 
	the bottom.</font></div>&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">First day:
	Oct 22nd 2004</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">The day began early, waking up at 3 am and leaving Tsukuba around 4:30 am 
	driving through the traffic jam near Nikko. By the time all the cars reached
	the car park, there was no time left for the difficult option. The weather 
	was good and the scenery was beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could view the autumn colours
	in abundance all around the trail. As we approached the hut, it started 
	drizzling, but it didn't hinder our views or walk and everyone reached the 
	hut much ahead of the map time.</font></div>&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">We had to kill about an hour before we could take our baths or dinner, which 
	was not difficult as we strolled around the marshes outside, and then 
	huddled near the warm heater for chatting.&nbsp; After the dinner it was women's 
	turn to get in Ohuro. I had just begun to relax in hot ohuro when the
	earthquake struck. I didn't feel much vibrations myself because I was in 
	water.&nbsp; Though I wondered why everything&nbsp; around me was shaking so violently 
	, I shrugged off my thought attributing it to the wooden hut. The other 
	Japanese lady who was with me&nbsp; panicked a bit but I persuaded her to stay in 
	while the milder tremors continued. When I came out,I was interrogated by
	Sweta and Yu on whether I had any clue to how dangerous was the earthquake.
	When they said it was 6.8, I realized how stupid I was to indulge in ohuro
	amidst the tremors.&nbsp; Many hikers stood outside apprehending more tremors. I 
	joined them too. Then we felt a big jolt and an equally big noise. Some 
	people who were inside rushed out in panic. For a moment, the hut&nbsp; seemed
	as if it might collapse.&nbsp; We stayed out in the freezing cold for about 30 
	minutes, and some people stayed on for about a couple of hours. Most 
	Japanese guests and staff were indifferent and cool and didn't step out at 
	all. They were in fact laughing at us when we rushed out. We had no access 
	to TV but through the news on radio and information on telephone we knew 
	that we were pretty close to the epicenter. We then discussed whether to go 
	back to the car park and sleep inside the cars or to stay outside and have a 
	camp fire. Eventually the tremors&nbsp; subsided and we decided to get in our 
	rooms and sleep. We kept a small bag with warm cloths and the stuff under 
	our pillow in case we had to make an emergency exit. I was sleeping right in 
	front of the door. Tremors continued through the night.&nbsp; I was too sleepy to 
	be intimidated by the tremors any more.&nbsp; I was more intimidated&nbsp; by my room 
	mates ,Nicolas,Sveta, Ajay and Ryoko stamping over me to rush out on a&nbsp; hint
	of vibration, even if it was .due to footsteps outside. Soon after everyone 
	fell asleep, Keitai alarms started buzzing in chorus at 6:00 am. Darn! some

	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">Day 2:
	Oct 23rd 2004</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">The morning after the shaky night was bright and sunny. Ajay and Ryoko
	successfully managed to get everyone out before 7:00, which was a good idea. 
	Oze looks more beautiful in the morning light and it was a picture perfect
	walk and weather.&nbsp; There were two groups - as usual. The faster group went 
	to see the river(I don't remember which river)&nbsp; and then climbed up shibutsu
	San. The slow group had plenty of time to enjoy the views and take pictures. 
	Some of the hikers climbed up Shibutsu San half way through to see the view
	from there. After we got-together, Ajay and Ryoko had a tough time noting
	down the options for hikers - which were - onsen,dinner (at El Torito), no
	onsen but dinner, no onsen no dinner, both onsen and dinner. Whew!! They
	looked so perplexed as people switched from their options stated earlier, 
	including me :).</font></div>&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">&nbsp;I ditched onsen and tagged along in Luc's car in a hope to reach Tsukuba
	early. However, we were stuck in a traffic jam and the cars who made it to 
	the onsen also reached around the same time as we did! When I called Alok to
	check out if there was any dinner left at home for me, he said he could give 
	me sandwiches. Oh no! We had enough of sandwiches and onigiris these two
	days. So we&nbsp; joined the gang at El Torito and the food at El Torito never
	tasted so oishi before!</font></div>&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">A big thanks to all the drivers! And everyone for their interesting 
	conversations.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
	<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#800000">Congratulations Luc ! For winning the photo contest and other achievements 
	too :)</font></div>&nbsp;<div>

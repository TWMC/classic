<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times">Hike report by Nicolas</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">The night hike is over and both cars came back safely to Tsukuba.<FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">The start of the hike was unusually late (for the club standard): 9pm
and... nobody came to 7/11 as almost everybody went directly to El Torito
(and EVERYBODY was almost on time at El Torito!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">During our dinner Tadashi joined us and later Jirka and Vitalik also came
(but just to say "bye" before leaving Japan).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Around 23:30 we left El Torito. We were 8 hikers (Will, Jan, James,
Saswattee, Ginny, Tadashi, Sveta and Nicolas) and 2 cars. After a stop at
a convenience store, we drove to the end of the hike where we left a car
at 1:00am. At 1:30 we started hiking from Atago Jinja in Iwama.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Weather was fine and we could see many stars in the sky(*) and the lights
of the kanto plain through the trees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">(*) Someone claims that he even saw an octuple (8) star, but I believe
that the Tequila added a few stars to the count.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">At around 3:00am we were in advance on the schedules and we made a long
eating break (can we call that a lunch break at 3:00am?).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Then the path became a bit slipery and some of us were slowed down. At
5:00am we realized that we were a bit behind the schedules and those who
could hurried to the summit of Wagakuni-san, but they reached it too late
for the sunrise at 5:30. We enjoyed the view from the summit anyway and
after a long breakfast/supper break we left these beautiful views around
6:30am to go back in the valley. Tadashi and Nicolas went first to go get
the cars.
The last hikers reached Fukuhara station around 8:45 and we left around
9:00 am.
At 10:00am we were all back in Tsukuba tired but happy after that unusual
hiking experience.</FONT></P>

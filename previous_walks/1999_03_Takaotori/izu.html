    <TD WIDTH="150" VALIGN="TOP"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">TRANSPORT DETAILS:</FONT></B></TD> 
    <TD><FONT SIZE="+1">Saturday:<BR>
      Train from Tsukuba (Arakawaoki) - 6:50 D - to Tokyo Eki. <BR>
      Train to Atami - 8:48 D, 10:40 A. Train to Shimoda - 10:43 D,
      12:26 A.<BR>
      (better to take an earlier train in Tokyo in order to have more
      time for the connection at Atami. Also, beware of timetable changes
      on weekends !)<BR>
      Bus from Shimoda to Dogashima via Matsuzaki. Buses run every
      hour or so, and take about 1 hour.<BR>
      Sunday:<BR>
      Bus from Youth Hostel Mae near Matsuzaki to Matsuzaki - about
      10 minutes.<BR>
      Bus from Matsuzaki to Kumomi (start and end of hike) - about
      30 minutes. Bus from Kumomi to Matsuzaki (runs every 40-50 min
      or so), then another bus to Shimoda (runs every hour or so),
      and the train journey in reverse direction (lots of trains to
      chose from..). <BR>
      So, one way from the 7/11 carpark to Matsuzaki takes about 7
      hours (without lunch break...).</FONT></TD>

    <TD WIDTH="150" VALIGN="TOP"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">MAPS/GUIDEBOOKS:</FONT></B></TD>

    <TD WIDTH="150" VALIGN="TOP"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">HIKE DESCRIPTION:</FONT></B></TD> 
    <TD><FONT SIZE="+1">3 hours return maximum. One third is on a
      small road. The other two-thirds are on a hill track in fairly
      good condition, although very slippery in wet weather ! Nice
      views of Mt Fuji (if the weather is OK) and of the coastline
      in several spots along the walk. At the end of the road, small
      ofuro with views of Fujisan (looked nice, but didn't try...).
      Fairly easy walking, which could be suitable for children in
      DRY conditions.<BR>
      P.S. Near the start of the walk, nice-looking camp site with
      views of the coast. Could be a good spot to stay in summer...</FONT></TD>

    <TD WIDTH="150" VALIGN="TOP"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">ACCOMMODATION
      DETAILS:</FONT></B></TD> 
    <TD><FONT SIZE="+1">Youth Hostel near Matsuzaki. Standard price
      (about 4000 yen), including dinner and breakfast. Details in
      Lonely Planet.</FONT></TD>

  <TR>
    <TD WIDTH="150" VALIGN="TOP"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">ONSEN DETAILS:</FONT></B></TD> 
    <TD><FONT SIZE="+1">Lots of onsens in the area ! Some people
      tried one in Dogashima located almost right in the ocean. In
      Matsuzaki, went to a large onsen (on a hill, about 15 min on
      foot from the bus station) which was pretty good. 1000 yen/person.</FONT></TD>

    <TD WIDTH="150" VALIGN="TOP"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">OTHER COMMENTS:</FONT></B></TD> 
    <TD><FONT SIZE="+1">This walk would be better suited for winter,
      when the weather is usually dry. The temperatures in Izu are
      generally higher than in Tsukuba. Perhaps other, more rewarding
      walks would be better considering the time spent in transport.</FONT></TD>

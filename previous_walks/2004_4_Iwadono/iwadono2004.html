<P><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><a name="report"></a>Report by Ginny:</font></b></P>
<div>
	<font face="Arial">Thanks to everyone who came on the hike on Sunday. 
	Despite being a large group (19 of us), everything went very smoothly, and we 
	managed to start hiking soon after 9.30 as planned. We had beautiful 
	weather, and were soon greeted with a perfect view of snow-clad Fuji-san - the 
	first for some recent arrivals to Japan. The beginning of the hike was a 
	steep path up to the top, from which we had lovely views. It was pretty 
	crowded, though - we overtook one group of 50 or so hikers on the way up, and 
	met another similarly sized group at the top - everyone was out 
	enjoying the sun! We stopped for a brief rest, and to allow one group to get 
	well ahead of us, but unfortunately we soon caught up with them and were 
	stuck in a &quot;traffic jam&quot; at the first set of chains! This little climb proved 
	just a taster for the follow-up - a narrow ledge followed by another climb 
	with chains over a very steep drop. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, although 
	some found it a little nerve-wracking... A large hiking group was already 
	lunching in a resting area, so we stopped a bit further along the path. 
	What we hadn't realised</font><font face="Arial"> was that not far away 
	was the spectacular high sheer cliff on top of which was a rocky outcrop perfect for a rest - and so 
	we stopped again to enjoy the views. The route down a lovely wooded path was 
	quite steep and punctuated by the occasional &quot;aaahhh&quot; as people slipped! 
	The hike was over all too quickly and we had plenty of time, but 
	unfortunately all the onsens were too far to walk to, and also could only take a few 
	people at a time, so we ended up walking back to Ootsuki. Whether it was the 
	relaxed mood, the hot sunny weather, the good company, or a combination of 
	everything, some of us couldn't resist buying a beer to drink as we stood 
	around chatting at the station. Since it was still early, some people decided to 
	make the most of the afternoon and got off the train at Shinjuku, while 
	others headed home. All in all it was a very enjoyable day. Thanks again to 
	everyone for coming along. </font></div>

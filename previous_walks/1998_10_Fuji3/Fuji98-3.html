<BR>
Last weekend's trip to Fuji-san was a great success -- many thanks
again to Thomas for the organisation, which included arranging
that the weather would be perfect on Sunday. <BR>
As expected, there were very few people in the hut (5th station)
where we spent Saturday night. 15 people only ! This included
the seven of us plus a few other interesting individuals: a South-African
businessman, two Chinese guys who had decided to climb Fuji instead
of visiting Tokyo, but forgot to bring warm clothes with them,
a musician from Germany, two Russians (father and son, the father
being close to 70 years of age) and a Polish astrophysicist. When
climbing the mountain, Tadashi was relieved to see that he was
not the only mad Japanese on the North side of Fuji -- we met
two men coming down the summit.</FONT></B></P>

After desperately trying to warm up our futons (the temperature
in the hut was probably near 0 degrees, and &quot;unfortunately&quot;
there were about 10 futon spaces per person...) it was decided
that walking up the mountain was a better way to get warm. We
set out on our walk at 4am. The sky was shining with stars, and
down the mountain one could see the lights of the nearby towns.
We saw the sunrise from near the 7th station. The snow on the
summit (yes, there was snow...) turned a light pink colour, and
the scenery north of Fuji took on lots of beautiful colours too,
which I find difficult to describe (but hopefully my camera did
a better job...). The great views were a good excuse for people
(well, me at least) to stop walking every five minutes. Cold wind,
smaller oxygen content and in places large amounts of snow made
the climb rather difficult. In fact, after the 8th station (or
was it the 9th ?) it felt more like crawling than walking ! It
was almost a surprise to see the top station with its toris and
lions, about 6 hours after we had started the climb. Lying in
the sun on the tables near the hut initially felt like a good
idea, but with the temperature probably near -10C, I quickly changed
my mind. We had an early lunch there, and also took lots of photographs
of ourselves (many of us felt amazed to have made it to the top
of Fuji, especially the two Chinese guys, who had had to borrow
warm clothes and boots from the 5th station). Of course the view
was pretty good (i.e. it was excellent !). Lots of mountain peaks
were visible in the distance, some covered with snow (presumably
the North Alps ?). To the east one could see the Pacific ocean,
and behind more mountains, the Kanto plain. Had I brought my binoculars
I may have been able to see Tsukuba, and perhaps even Hot Staff
!?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Our walk continued along the
crater for a while, then went down the Fujinomiya route, on the
south face of Fuji. To our surprise, many people were climbing
the mountain on this route. But the conditions were much kinder,
with hardly any wind and a warm sun. There was still a lot of
snow, and it was great fun to leap down the track, often sliding
uncontrollably. Lars and Marcus (the musician) even tried sliding
on plastic bags, which was not easy with backpacks. A pity I didn't
manage to take pictures of their antics ! But Abdou couldn't escape
being immortalised by the camera, as he was trying to keep his
balance in a rather ballet-like way... Further down, the track
became very monotonous and clouds hid most of the view, so everybody
was happy to arrive at the bottom of the walk. Going to Gotemba
station was a bit of an adventure, as some of us hitch-hiked their
way there. Coming down the Skyline road from Fuji, in the distance
one could see the volcano covered in snow -- very pretty.<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">By now you're probably tired
of reading this account of the Fuji walk, so I'll stop soon. But
not before saying that for people who want to climb Japan's highest
mountain but don't want to feel like they're caught in a traffic
jam in Tokyo, late autumn seems to be the best time. And Fuji-san
even looks beautiful, thanks to the snow !<BR>

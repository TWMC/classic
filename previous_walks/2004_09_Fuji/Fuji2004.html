			<td>
			<div>
				<b><font face="Arial"><a name="report"></a>Report by Nicolas</font></b><p>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">In total 22 persons joined 
				the Fuji-san hike (including many new members) this saturday.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Saturday around noon when I 
				checked the weather forecast, it was cloudy but no rain (except 
				a little shower that was forecasted around midnight) and JWA 
				claimed a rain probability of only 30%...</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">When we reached the Fuji 
				area, it was raining a little bit which was disappointing but 
				still not too bad. When the bus started to climb Mount Fuji the 
				little rain became stronger and we started to worry. During our 
				dinner we could not really enjoy the view of the 5 lakes area, 
				but we could see big lightenings in the sky around us.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Then we split into two groups 
				(around 19:30): one group was to start hiking from the 5th 
				station, whereas the other one was to start from a place close 
				from the 4th station.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">The beginning of the hike 
				from the 4th station was fine (under a small rain) but after 30 
				minutes the rain became much stronger. A few minutes later the 
				group reached the 5th station were they went to shelter 
				themselves under a roof where... the other group was already 
				waiting for a better weather.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Around 21:00 the owner of the 
				hotel in front of which we were sheltered offered us to stay in 
				his establishment for the night (for 5000yen/person) telling us 
				that there was no hope to go further than the 7th station as 
				there had been landslides (claim that seems to be untrue)...</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">The wisest half of the group 
				decided that the weather was too bad to start hiking and thus 
				accepted the offer of the hotel owner whereas the other half 
				decided to try to go to the 7th station and decide then.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Those who went to the hotel 
				had a nice chat while eating some more of their provisions and 
				then spent the night sleeping in a safe, dry and warm place...</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">As the thunderstorm was over, 
				the other half took the way to the summit.&nbsp; After a while the 
				rain became less intense. We passed the 6th station without 
				difficulties and then we reached the 7th station without any 
				problems. Of course, we were wet and a bit cold but so far, it 
				was not too bad. On our way to the 8th station, we experienced 
				the &quot;Fuji-procession&quot;: it was about time for the groups having 
				rest in the huts to wake up and start hiking, thus creating jams 
				at the most difficult points of the trail.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">The path followed by the 
				trail was like a very long Christmas garland with red and green 
				lights blinking.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">At the 8th station some of us 
				were getting very tired and considered stopping to have at least 
				a short rest, but we were so close from the summit that 
				everybody decided to continue (and the 5500 yen/person charged 
				by the huts [without drying facility] even for just one hour of 
				rest helped to take that decision).</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">After the 8th station the 
				rain became more intense and the wind became stronger. We hardly 
				reached the summit around 4:30am, 30 minutes before the sunrise 
				but we were all very wet and cold and decided that there was no 
				point to wait for the sunrise as the weather was very cloudy.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Thus we decided to go down as 
				soon as possible without doing the loop around the caldera. The 
				path down was much easier than the way up: soon there was enough 
				daylight to turn off our headlights and at 8am we were back at 
				the 5th station where we met the wise hikers and the bus driver.
				</font></div>
			<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">We then went to an onsen and 
				came back to Tsukuba around 13:40.</font></div>
&nbsp;<div>
				<font face="Arial" color="#000080">My conclusion: do not trust 
				the weather forecast!</font></div>

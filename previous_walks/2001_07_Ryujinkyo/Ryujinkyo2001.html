<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Hi everybody,</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Here is a report of the Ryuzinkyo trip
on the last Sunday, July 8. As you knew, unwanted incident needing
to call for help happened at the very end of the walk in this
trip. I try to describe what we did and what happened based on
facts and analyze the causes of the incident wishing that such
a thing will never happen.<BR>
Therefore, there is no intention to blame someone here (I know
I am the no.1 to be blamed). I simplly wish this report will be
productive.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Actual summary of the trip is as follows
(Since some of the time records may not be accurate, please let
us know if you have more accurate records such time stamps of
digital camera images).</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">First of all, I must say that difficulty
grading of the walk was greatly underestimated. I did take almost
the same route twice about 15 years ago. My memories of the walks
were not clear but I remembered clearly that more than half of
the participants were high-school students for both trips and
I knew one of my collegues were a biginner. Therefore, I thought
there existed easy bypath routs although I knew non-bypath routs
are rather difficult. I should not have indicated &quot;relatively
easy&quot; but I agree that I shoud have graded ***. It was my
great mistake.<BR>
To cover my unclearness of my momery, I decided to bring an handy
GPS (rented from another mountneering club of my institute). After
unloading participants at the starting point, Ryuzin Suspension
Bridge, drivers (Melissa, Shinji and me) drove their cars to the
intended end point of the trail, Nakatakyu. We left Melissa's
and my cars there. At this point, I memorized the position by
the GPS in order to make us easily come back to our cars.<BR>
The three drivers went back by Shinji's car to a point inbetween
named Ryuzin-Furusato-mura, got off the car and start walking
to catch up with the others. Soon after, the drivers easily merged
with the others. Real walking started from Kamegafuchi at around
11 am since the waliking until this point was on a paved road.
You can get rough image of the walk from the photos posted on
the mailing list. If draw a straight line from Kamegafuchi to
the waterfall which was the end target of the Ryuzin-gawa, its
distance is ony 2.5 km. However, since the river is winding and
there are many obstacles it takes much time. It was about 15:45
when we finally arrived at the waterfall.<BR>
In spite of my misgrading, the participants succesfully reached
the waterfall. Judging from the result, we should not have spent
such much time (15:45-16:30) there. Relating to the time schedule,
after all we left Tsukuba 50 minutes later than scheduled. This
delay could have been shortened too.<BR>
Before reaching the waterfall, we saw a red arrow drawn on a rock
at an intersection of a branch river. considering its location
and direction of the arrow, I took it shows a trail leading to
Nakatakyu, our parking place. I checked its location by GPS and
marked on a map (1/25000). By looking terrains around us, the
location given by GPS seemed reasonably accurate and I confirmed
that the branch trail shown by the red arrow suitably leads to
our parking space. The GPS showed that the distance to our cars
was only 1.3km (in a straight line). Considering tha fact actual
trail is winding, I tought at the time we could come back to our
cars in about 1 hour or so. However, the reality was not after
all! (We were told later, if you do not lost, it takes about 1
hour, same as my guess) After spending a time at the waterfall,
we came back to the red arrow and follow the arrow. The arrow
is directed to upstream of a branch river but a little tilted
to the right. In that direction, there are a series of red piles/
red paints, which is departing the branch river. We followed the
series of red piles. After all, we were told later red piles does
not show a trail but merely show the border between a national
forest and private forest! Anyway, it turned out we could have
come back without problem if we had departed from the red piles
on a peak.<BR>
What we did in reality was to keep follwoing the red piles and
started to descend in a very steep slope. There were two reasons
why I did not stop descending immediately. The first big reason
was that the GPS showed our cars in that direction of the descent
although I began wondering if it was really correct from a little
before the time. The socond reason was that we saw an isolated
private house on our right of the descending slope. I knew car
road was located east of us on a ridge. The slope went west. Although
the direction was opposite, I had a slight expectation that there
might be a path leading to the house ahead.<BR>
While I was wondering, some preceding walkers went down far ahead.
The steepness of the slope was not normal. Rocks were easy to
fall down. The distance to the house was becoming farwer. Then
I decided to climb up again. It was lucky that I was able to deliver
my decision by person to person to all the preceders. Here is
another point that we should learn. People should reasonably stick
together especially in such a case. I understand the preceders
wanted to vollunteer to find a right path for the rest of us but
in that case I must say there was a danger that we were not able
to communicate any more. I should have orgnized in advance to
avoid such risk.<BR>
We gathered on a middle point of the slope where the house could
be seen from the woods almost at the same level but it seemed
hard to reach due to a deep gorge inbetween (we knew later the
distance between our place and the house was about 400 m). Luckily,
a housewife of the house kindly came out and we were barely able
to communicate in a loud voice (it was sad to know my voice did
not work. Masako's voice was No.1. Thank you very much for you
voice, Masako!) We knew she does not know how to and cannot reach
our place. I wanted to know the location of the car road but the
communication was not succesful.<BR>
The sun was setting soon. I still had a hope to reach our car
if we climbed up. I asked people to stay there and then Victor
and I started climb and tried to find a path to the house or to
the road. We could not find a path to the house. Soon after, we
decided to call for help through the lady.<BR>
Shiji had a mobile phone. He thought first the area was out of
range but suddenly knew it was available! Therefore, he also made
a phone call for help to the police. I cannot remember when first
rescue team arrived at the house. Finally they came to us by traversing
the gorge. After asking questions, we were aligned in an order
of man after woman and rescue members were distributed among us
to guide us to walk. The rescue team guided us to the exit of
the forest by taking a different roue from the rescue team took.
We climbed up to the peak and diversed from the red piles.<BR>
Finally, we were escaped from the woods and welcomed by a huge
crowd of people, ambulance cars, and police cars. We knew later
village mayors wife was serving tea to us. It turned later that
the place was very close to our cars.<BR>
I am really relieved to know nobody got panicked, had positive
minded- light mood atomosphere and shared foods and water in a
difficult situation. I greatly appreciate cooperation of our companies.<BR>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">(Terry's second report below)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Hi everybody,</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">This is a second part of the Ryuzinkyo
trip report.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">You might say that the participants in
this trip was mislead by the leader, me. And, I was mislead (confused!)
partly by the GPS, I would say....<BR>
After checking the records of GPS and revisiting the places (when
we did thank-you tour), I was able to plot our actual trace at
the end of the walk and found out a problem of the GPS (system).
You can see our actual trace (shown by a red line) on the map
at the site below: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/terrysaito/Ryuzinkyo/Okuryuzin.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/terrysaito/Ryuzinkyo/Okuryuzin.jpg</A></FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Specification of the GPS (Magellan GPS
315) says;<BR>
Position accuracy: 15 meters RMS (with Selective Availability
turned off).</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Selective Availability is an error intentionally
introduced for public use by American Department of Defence (DoD).
I think the DoD decided to stop using Selective Availability several
years ago. Therefore, accuracy for public use is as good as for
military use. It was my understanding about the GPS system at
the trip and I think still it is correct.<BR>
However, hard to belive, what really happened when I marked the
position of my car (and Melissa's car. Marked by a blue point
on the right on the map) was that the GPS reading of its location
was falsely located (marked by a left blue point) west of the
actual poit by 1 km! I still have an evidence of the records with
its time stamp in the GPS. I memerized the location twice for
safety. Both records are exactly the same except for the time
stamp and they read:<BR>
latitude: 36-42-43 N<BR>
longitude: 140-26-27 E<BR>
elevation: 1320 m<BR>
time: 10:14:44am 08Jul01</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Three days later after the trip, I and
some other represetatives did a thank-you tour and we visited
the same place again. I brought the same GPS and marked the same
place again. The reading was as shown below and it exactly matched
the location of the map.<BR>
latitude: 36-42-49 N<BR>
longitude: 140-26-56 E<BR>
elevation: 477 m<BR>
time: 01:57:51pm 11Jul01</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Note the difference not only of latitude
&amp; longitude but also of elevation. At the false location,
there is no terrain with such high elevation, and no road. Therefore,
it is clear that the GPS reading at the time on Sunday had a exceptionally
significant error in location.<BR>
There was a supporting evidence/witness about this. It was about
5 minutes before I marked the point on 8 th, Sunday. Since we
were not sure about the place where we should park, I checked
the location by Shinji's car GPS navigation system. The display
showed his car trace on a map. We were a bit surprised to see
that the car trace was not on the road but deviated to the west
very much (somewhere between the road and Ryuzingawa).<BR>
Therefore, it is highly likely the position error was not caused
by the receivers themselves but by the satelite signal condition
and/or some special environmental condition (such as reflection?).
In principle, error can be large when number of catched satelites
is not many and all the satelites are located in a close direction.
I knew later after reading the user manual that the GPS shows
estimated position error. However, it is only shown for a little
while when the receiver succesfully catch enough number of satelites
and there is no record for it. Therefore, we cannot know how big
the error at the time was. Usually, the position error reads surprisingly
small such as less than 10 m.<BR>
Wise readers may say that we should have noticed the misreading
when two GPS showed such similar behaviors. However, I did not
notice anything strange about my handy GPS at the time. Now, I
can say I should have paid attention on the GPS location information
such as elevation and/or checked its proper operation by verifying
its location on a map.<BR>
In addition to such happening of unusual misreading, I would like
to tell you one other important point about the use of GPS. It
is a setting of map datum. I knew a little bit about this. I thought
it was ok because in the very first use of the GPS, an intialization
screen came out and it asked about the area of the user. Therefore,
I thought an appropriate map datum was automatically chosen. However,
I have known it was not! I have known this because when we revisted
the places, all the location given by the GPS were displaced to
the northwest by 500 m compared to the map location. It turns
out that world-wide map datum, WGS84, was used. By switching to
Tokyo datum, the position information in the GPS memories matched
exactly to the map location. Of course, the GPS should have been
set so earlier.<BR>
However, this setting does not affect so-called &quot;Goto&quot;
function which was used for coming back to our cars at the trip
because the function is kind of relative within the system based
on its own reference and does not refer to outer world location
reference such as latitude and longitude of a map.<BR>
We have learned a lot through this experience. In addition to
the preveous report, let me add a little. We were lost in the
area where the highest elevation is only 560 m. Therefore, don't
judge difficulty simply from the elevation. We were lost at a
point where the nearest house is only 250 m* apart and the nearest
car road is only 200 m apart and had to stay after sunset. Therefore,
observe the instruction about what to bring such as a flashlight.
As for GPS, although we still cannot assign a true cause of such
big position error, we knew such big position error can happen.
Therefore, we should keep in mind about this possibility and always
excute double check. If we observe this, I think a GPS is really
useful.<BR>

<P><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000"><a name="report"></a>Report by 
Michal:</font></b><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Hello everyone :) </font> </div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">We have successfully climbed Okuhotakadake and Yarigadake via Daikiretto
	and safely returned back. Mission completed. <br>
	And now I will try to
	describe how beautiful it was. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Start: Daniel, Victoria, Alexander and me took a bus from Tsukuba to
	Tokyo - Shinjuku at Friday 20:30. <br>
	Since we had some time before
	departure of our train, we sat down, observed girls and ate chocolate.
	Daniel went shopping :)) <br>
	After we spent some time with this leisure
	activities, we moved to the platform, where we met Mariush and Jackson.
	</font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Unfortunately, at that moment (cca 7 min. before the train leaving) we
	discovered an interesting fact, that all the seats in this train are
	reserved <br>
	and we would not officially be allowed to board in. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">In an desperate attempt to buy reservation, me and Mariush rushed to the
	ticket office only to found a Japanese officer who confirmed above
	stated situation. </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Since this particular train was the only one by which we could get to
	the Matsumoto station in time, we just board in and stopped worrying
	about seat reservation <br>
	and decided to try passive resistance in case
	someone would try to throw us away. Fortunately this was not necessary. 
<br>
	Additional 3000Y to the conductor solved whole situation. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">After this slight struggle and few hours trying to sleep in train we
	finally came to Matsumoto station, where we changed train <br>
	and moved to
	Shinshimashima station where we boarded bus and finally came to
	Kamikochi. </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">The weather was quite fine, time to time a cloud, but otherwise clear
	sky. We started hiking towards Okuhotakadake at about 7:15 am. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">We were optimistic, full of energy and looking forward for whatever
	adventure was in front of us. Thus we walked quite quickly and
	everything went smoothly <br>
	except the weather, which started to change
	gradually and at about 50 m below the Okuhotakadake peak we were caught
	by heavy rain <br>
	and time to time we could hear thunder roaring around.
	Luckily enough, we made it to the hut in a 15 min. or so and hide
	ourselves inside. <br>
	What a relief! </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Fortunately, this was not the end of our luck :) In a while the sky
	cleared itself again and we could enjoy our lunch outside <br>
	as well as
	really beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. I cannot prevent
	myself from describing the lunch as simply delicious. <br>
	Everyone took out
	of their bags the best and I had not such a tasteful food for a couple
	of months :) <br>
	Beside this, we could observe beautiful sunset and a
	strange but impressive rainbow phenomena, which occurred at that place. 
	</font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">After dinner, we sat down in the hut, enjoyed tea (150Y for a cattle 
	(kettle?)!)
	and talked with nice Japanese girls :) <br>
	After that more Japanese young
	people came and we started a small party with a lot of fun including
	Victoria's vodka :))) </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Alex and me then stayed outside time to time sleeping and time to time
	observing beautiful sky with falling stars. <br>
	Meanwhile the others
	suffered snoring of other hikers in the room and could hardly sleep at
	all. :) </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Unfortunately, Jackson suffered some high altitude ache and decided to
	go back to Kamikochi. <br>
	He took an easier route down and so we wished luck
	to each other and parted in the morning.</font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">In the morning the rest of us started early after sunrise and moved
	along sharp and high mountain ridge towards Daikiretto. <br>
	The weather was
	just wander (wonder)-full and we had breath taking views of the mountains around.
	</font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">We approached Daikiretto with a mixed feelings. But after we climbed down
	without major problems and had this adrenaline part left behind, <br>
	we were
	all happy and we adjudged it as a nice sports-like part :))
	But this is not to say, that it was peace (piece) of cake. Definitely not.
	<br>
	I completely agree with the statement which describes Daikiretto as
	requiring clear thinking and the ability to grasp firmly whatever is
	needed to grasp :) <br>
	And for sure, people with fear of sights shall not go
	this way.</font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">From Daikiretto we continued until we reached Yarigadake, occasionally
	making a small brake to eat something or refresh ourselves at the hut. 
	</font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">When we reached the Yarigadake-sansou (the hut immediately under the
	Yari peak) the weather changed and it was starting to rain <br>
	and we could
	also hear some slight thunder, but far far away. We hide ourselves at
	the hut and than Mariush and Daniel decided to climb the Yari peak. <br>
	Me,
	Victoria and Alex were waiting for more favourable conditions.</font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">After a while Mariush and Daniel returned and we agreed to meet in the
	lower situated hut. <br>
	Than Alex, Victoria and me grow impatient and
	climbed the Yari peak as well. <br>
	We were lucky because of the slightly bad
	weather there was no one on the peak. <br>
	The only problem was that because of
	the mist and clouds, we could not see much from the peak of Yari. <br>
	Then
	we all gathered at the hut and spent nice evening sitting at the table,
	looking around and chatting. <br>
	Then again me and Alex stayed outside
	overnight. This time it was slightly warmer and we had quite a good
	sleep. <br>
	In the morning we all wake up before sunrise - sky was clear and
	the weather beautiful once again. <br>
	We were too lazy to go up to Yari
	again, partly because we could see the crowd waiting for the opportunity
	to climb up. <br>
	So I had enjoyed sunrise on the nearby ridge and soon after we started for 
	our final walk down the river to Kamikochi. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">The final day walk was an easy one and we relaxed and took delights in
	looking at the mountains, river and trees around. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">In one nice place nearby a some hut, we took a rest and me and Alex 
	exploited
	the chance and jump into the stream to take a refreshing bath. <br>
	I
	recommend this to everyone :))</font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Than we quickly and without trouble reached Kamikochi and while waiting
	for the bus to Shinshimashima, we ate lunch or whatever food we spared
	until that moment. </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">This was more or less the end of our adventure, followed only by travel
	to Tokyo by slow local trains. <br>
	We slept or talked most of the time. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">As a final note I would say that this trip was great and I am sure
	everyone enjoyed it very much. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">I would like to express my deep thanks to all participants, who bravely
	kept going even in rain and were a great company, <br>
	with special thanks to
	Jackson who was able to appreciate his state of body and decided not to
	go further, but climbed the highest peak of the walk anyway. <br>
	And to
	Victoria, who was the only girl there and who proved to be as hard as a
	rock.</font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Also I want to thank Paul for his help with organising the trip and
	providing us with very useful informations. <br>
	Without his help this trip
	could equally well be a terrible failure.&nbsp; <br>
	Last but not least I would like 
	to
	thank Mariush and Daniel who were not lazy and organised important
	travel details like tickets and insurance.&nbsp; <br>
	Again, this was a much
	appreciated help. </font></div><font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Advice for next hikers: I did not book any hut and this was not
	necessary, maybe because of the bad weather forecast there were not many
	people there. <br>
	I recommend to stay at the Okuhotakadake-sansou, because
	the view from the point is nice and because the tea service is also
	nice. <br>
	What shall be done next time is reservation of the Moonlight
	express from Tokyo. <br>
	Be aware of shortage of water supply. It is possible
	to buy water at a hut (usually 200Y per liter), but the huts are
	separated by several hours of walk. <br>
	Especially if one wants to cook his
	own food, water turns out to be one of the critical parameters.&nbsp; <br>
	In case
	of rain, make sure you have protected yourself and your bag as well from
	the water! <br>
	Sleeping in a wet sleeping bag is not something you want to
	experience twice. At least what I can say :))) <br>
	Start early. Best is to
	wake up some time before sunrise and quickly after leave for the walk. <br>
	Some hikers could use gloves or helmet at the harder parts. But we did
	it without such an equipment quite well. </font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Blisters came, muscle ache came, sharp sunshine came. Be aware of this. 
	</font> 
</div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">See you all in HotSuff on Wednesday ! :)</font></div>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">
<br>
&nbsp;</font><div>
	<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Best regards</font></div>

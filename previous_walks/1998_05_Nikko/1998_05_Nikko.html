<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Hi everybody!<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Let me first introduce myself.
My name is Archana and I was one of the participants for the Nikko
trip. My husband Alok is an employee of NRIM. I've been in Japan
for 8 months. We have a
4 year old son. We're from India. I have a littlebit of experience
of walking on the mountains of India (including Himalayas). Having
lived on Himalayas for four years, Alok is more experienced than
me. For this Nikko trip we deceide that Alok takes care of the
baby while I join the group. Next time it'll be my turn for babysitting.
We would like to go with the baby if there are more families with
the babies and the walking course is of simpler and flatter type.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Nikko trip was my first serious
hiking venture after the last one I had in Himalayas five years
ago. This club is a fantastic idea and has helped me in getting
back to hiking. It was one of the most enjoyable and adventurous
trip I've ever had and I am happy I came back alive. Not to mention
about my stiff knees and legs. I would like to thank all of you.
We had highly specialized manpower (and womenpower). I don't have
to say anything about John. You already know his organizing skills
are great. We couldn't have possibly managed without Koichi, who
was constantly being troubled by all ofus for translating what
we wanted to communicate to local people and also the maps in
Kanji. If he was not around we would turn to Nadia who is also
very good in her Nihongo skills. Paul was the strongest and fittest
of all -always walking at least 3 Kms ahead of the rest of us.
And we had a highly skilled and experienced couple Luc and Nadia
who have climbed up to Fuji Luc - 3 times!!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">I congratulate twmc for its first
successful hike. Archana</FONT></P>

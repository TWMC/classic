Izu hike was really great!!! 
We started our journey from Tsukuba at 4:16 am on 19 th (wakin' up at 
early mornin was only the horrible part of this hike)on first day we 
climbed Mansaburou-dake (1,406m) and Manjirou-dake(1,300m)and back to 
the youth hostel. dinner was also delicious (I hope for archana too , 
actually she ordered vegetarian meal but surprised to see crab, 
chicken and beef in her plate!!!) 2nd day was threaten by rain. But 
we should really acknowledge the kind cooperation of the rain clouds. 
We visited southern part of Izu, rock formation (artificial or 
natural??) and the sea side onsen (we visited the onsen seeing one 
add, but some thing was missing from the real and add!!!) 
Thanks Akira for organizing this trip as well as for drivin the long 
distance.</P>
 <P>Report 2 by Roman:
Indeed last weekend's hike was really great in every
respect. even the weather cooperated eventually.
A big applause to akira for the perfect organization
and all the driving!
And thanks a lot to archana for providing the second
car, which made the beautiful seaside hike on sunday
possible. </P>
 <P>Report 3 by Archana:
Ajay and Roman have already written enough about the trip. Here are some
additional comments.
It being my first experience of driving on mountains, was more of an
adventurous drive than hike for me. Thanks Masako for taking over when I was
tired.
The forests we hiked in have interesting flora and fauna. We had the
privilege of being escorted by a forest tree researcher (Akira), who knew
some interesting facts about the flora of the region. Regarding the fauna, I
guess we were the only creatures(visible)  who inhabited the place, if only
temporarily. Akira told us about a tree called Ashibi. If the horse eats its leave, it behaves like a drunkard. I am
wondering whether he experimented this on himself , or on a real horse ;-),
or on both to conclude this finding. Anyway those who are interested in
trying this cheap substitute for liquor,  might find a picture here and many
others.
Yu was assigned the task of a special shoot in the onsen. Ajay, objects (or
subjects?!) of that ad of the onsen were actually in onna no ohiro!! But
since there was too much steam around, and also perhaps our photographer was
shivering from fever, or may be she tried Ashibi mistaking it to be an
indigenous herb to cure her fever, those pictures aren't clear. I am pasting
the pictures of us hikers only - so sorry. May be next time you bribe Yu so
that she does a better job.</P></H5></FONT FACE="Arial">

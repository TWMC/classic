			us left Tsukuba at 5.30 am (Zsolt, Midori, Gunther, Tadashi, and 
			Ginny) and drove to Okutama arriving earlier than anticipated at 
			around 7.30am. Since we still had a bit of time before Michael's 
			train was due, some of us explored the river and station area. 
			Michael arrived on schedule at 8.21, and so we got started. And 
			lost. Fortunately some friendly locals sent us back on the right 
			track, and we saw the huge sign we'd missed pointing us in the right 
			direction for Honita yama. The trail led up a steep path for about 
			an hour and a half to the summit&nbsp; -- it was very hot, too, and 
			Michael (on his first experience of mountains in Japan) was feel a 
			bit queasy, so Ginny and Tadashi accompanied him back down the 
			shortest route to Hatanosu, while Gunther, Zsolt and Midori went on 
			to do the planned route via Kawanori yama. Back in Hatonosu, after 
			seeing Michael onto a train back to Chofu, we went for an onsen in 
			Okutama, collected the car and returned to Hatonosu to wait for the 
			others. Since they hadn't yet called in, we walked down to the 
			river, where we were amazed to discover a stunning riverscape with 
			green pools, white rapids, waterfalls, rocky outcrops and caves. The 
			others turned up around 4.30 tired from their long walk in the heat, 
			but we forced them to walk down to have a look at the river anyway. 
			Then we got back on the road and were pleasantly surprised to find 
			the traffic via the Kanetsu expressway wasn't too heavy, so we were 
			back in Tsukuba soon after 7pm or so. We had dinner at Yamato zushi, 
			and still managed to get an early night!</font></div>

			<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Despite the 
			rain, everybody turned up to the 7-11 - the organiser was the last 
			to turn up :) but even so we could get away on time. 
			Unfortunately, 
			the traffic was slow in Tokyo, and we kept Chiho waiting 10 minutes 
			or so in Hakone Yumoto. Well, we still had to wait around a bit for 
			Elena, but Lloyd didn't turn up even though he phoned to say he was 
			on the way.&nbsp; The good news was that by the time we did get started,
			the weather had 
			cleared and we had some magnificent views from the ropeway of&nbsp; Mount 
			Fuji and surrounding area, still with some incredibly bright autumn 
			colours.&nbsp; We stopped at Owakudani for a breakfast of black eggs that 
			had been cooked in its boiling sulphurous water. Then we had a
			bit of trouble 
			finding the start of the trail to Komagatake peak. Some other 
			walkers told us the trail was closed by landslides so we should
			get the bus 
			instead. We ignored them and eventually managed find the start of 
			the trail. It was blocked off, with a sign saying it was closed
			due to fallen 
			trees - well, fallen trees aren't landslides, so we decided to have 
			a go. We did have to climb over, under, and around a few trees, and the 
			trail was overgrown and a bit tricky to follow in places, but it was 
			definitely worth the effort for the great views over Lake Ashinoko. The 
			bright sunshine sadly gave away to dense fog on the top of 
			Komagatake, although this did eventually clear just enough to see 
			from one side of the 
			summit to the other. On the ropeway down, we finally got some more 
			lovely views once we got below cloud level. We took the boat over to Hakone 
			Sekisho, the former checkpoint on the old Tokaido highway, and then 
			walked along the famous avenue of magnificent cedars. We managed to 
			walk a little way down the old highway, but the stones were very 
			slippery and it was getting too dark in amongst the trees, so we eventually 
			climbed up onto the main road to find a bus stop. The bus was packed 
			to overflowing, but the driver kept everyone entertained with jokes all the 
			way back to Hakone Yumoto. We found a nice onsen with rotenburo 
			jacuzzi and hot tubs, and then had dinner in the only place still open that 
			had enough space for thirteen people - not to everyone's taste, but 
			the curry rice was very nice :) Fortunately the traffic had cleared and we 
			got back to Tsukuba in just under two hours and were home by eleven. 
			All in all it was a highly enjoyable day - thank you very much to Gunther 
			for organizing it and buying all the tickets and doing all the 
			complicated calculations of expenses!</font></div>

			By the way, I forgot to mention the bit about the organizer being so 
			busy reorganizing his backpack several times that he failed to 
			notice the rest of us 
			getting on board the ropeway car - everyone (including the ropeway 
			operator and a few other waiting passengers) tried to get his attention 
			but he was oblivious. By the time he had finished with his backpack, 
			he looked up to see us receding in the distance waving goodbye.... Of 
			course, we waited for him to arrive (redfaced) at Owakudani station

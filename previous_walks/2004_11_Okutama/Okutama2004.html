			Thanks to everyone who joined the Okutama hike! 
			It was a bit confusing, with many people joining and dropping out 
			right until the last minute, but eventually about 17 of us boarded 
			the train at Shinjuku. Along with the rest of Tokyo, it seemed 
			(clearly, the perfect weather and autumn colours were attracting many people to leave the comfort of 
			Sunday morning lie-in).<br>&nbsp;</font></div>
		<div>
			<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Unfortunately, having got on what we thought was 
			the front of the train headed for Okutama, we found it was actually 
			the back of the train headed goodness-knows-who-where, so we had to 
			abandon our seats and squeeze onto the already crowded front 
			carriages.<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
		<div>
			<font face="Arial" color="#000080">Twelve of us got of at Hinatawada to do the easy 
			hike, while the &quot;difficult&quot; walkers stayed on. The weather was sunny 
			and warm, and Hinatawada itself was surprisingly beautiful, with a 
			glorious view of autumn colours as we crossed a gorge to find the 
			mountain trail. Despite a somewhat misleading map, we eventually 
			found the entrance to the shrine at the start of the walk, and left 
			the mundane world behind. The ridge walk to Hinode Yama followed a 
			very easy, pleasant wooded trail, with tantalizing glimpses of the 
			promised views through the trees. We came across one or two other 
			hikers, and a mountain bike, but otherwise we had the lovely 
			peaceful surroundings to ourselves. It was a bit of a shock, then, 
			to arrive at the summit of Hinode Yama to find it already packed 
			with hikers enjoying the lovely all-round views and cooking their 
			lunches on gas stoves! Most of them had just walked over from the 
			cable car station on nearby Mitake... We managed to squeeze a little 
			space for ourselves to relax and have lunch and enjoy the views over 
			the Tanzawa mountains and the Tokyo metropolis. Fuji-san, as usual, 
			was being coy but still the views were great. </font>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">After a while, though, one particularly large 
			group started a sing-song and we decided it was time to head for 
			Mitake san. We already sensed that Mitake san was a pretty popular 
			place as we met so many people on the way. But we were still 
			surprised to be greeted by a goat in an old farmhouse. Mitake is 
			really quite a large village, complete with thatched minka­style 
			houses, hotels, omiyage shops, cable car and, of course, the 
			impressive shrine on the summit. This was where we were supposed to meet up with the other group, but since their 
			phones were still out of range, daylight time was limited, and we 
			were still full of energy, we decided to go ahead and walk down to 
			Kori. <br><br>This walk was maybe the nicest of the day. Having found our way 
			through the maze of streets on Mitake to the beginning of the trail, 
			we were greeted with some stunning mountain scenery and autumn 
			colours. It was difficult to believe we were still in the Tokyo 
			metropolitan area! Daylight was already failing as we started the 
			steep descent through the woods, but everyone made it down before 
			dark.<br><br>Some decided to go straight back to Tsukuba, and the rest of us had 
			thought of going to Okutama for an onsen, but as we finally made 
			contact with the other group, who had just arrived via cable car 
			from the summit of Mitake to the station, we decided to change our 
			plans and go there instead. There don¹t seem to be any public onsens in Mitake, but 
			we did find one ryokan with a public bath. Unfortunately it could 
			only accommodate 5 people at a time (well, a little optimistic), so 
			the girls went first while the guys drank some beer and waited for 
			their turn. By the time everyone had taken a bath, we decided it was a bit late to go for 
			dinner (and we'd already enjoyed some tsumami with the beer), so 
			everyone headed straight for home. All in all, it was a very 
			pleasant day, with fantastic weather, easy walking, and great 
			company. Thanks to all for joining.<br>

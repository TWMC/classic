<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times">Hike report by Jan</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">We had a great hike on Sunday on Akagi san. We started out at 5.45 at HS
and drove to Akagi san. It was a rather cold day (the sign around the
parking area said it was -1 degree when we arrived at around 9am) and when
we arrived the tops of the vulcano rim were still covered in clouds.
Nevertheless after starting the hike and ascending the first couple of
meters we got warmed up and the cold seemed to fade away. We had some
lovely views of the main lake inside Akagi san and the surrounding plane.
We managed to stay way ahead of map time and so we had enough time to
climb the second highest peak in that area where we had a nice view but
had to descend a bit before having lunch because up there a chilly wind
blew into our clothes.<FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Around that time the last clouds lifted to higher grounds and started to
vanish so we had very nice walking conditions for the rest of the hike.
Some time later we found out that we should invest in newer maps more
often and not try to update them if they are older than 5 years since the
way we wanted to walk seemed to have disappeared in bushes and another way
that was not on the map was distracting us from the way. We decided to
nevertheless try to stick to the original way and nearly got completely
lost. Somehow we found another way then (which I still suspect to be
related to the newer way from before since it seemed well intact ... but
maybe not ...)That way turned out to be the one on the map again and we had no problem
finishing the hike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">The last hour was getting very cold since we had to walk just along the
lake on the streets (the only other way would have meant another 500
meters of altitude up and down in about 1 hour before sunset). The wind
there was getting rather stong and with the declining sun we started to
freeze. The greater was our shock when we finally arrived at the car and
found the drivers window being smashed and our things in disorder. Nothing
was taken (nobody seemed to want our Onsen stuff) and it was a completly
useless act. It made us clean the car in the cold wind and we were all
very upset. We managed to temporarily fix the window with some plastic
foil and tape at the next gas station and when the heating eventually
showed effect our spirits lifted and we decided to go for an Onsen and
nice dinner nevertheless.
So all in all it was a very nice hike with a small bugger.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Thanks to everyone participating for the great hike :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Times">Hike report by Lester</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">I enjoyed it very much. In the early morning on the mountain there
was still no sun, but it was nice. later in the morning the sky was
mostly clouds scattered over a brilliant blue background. Later in the
afternoon we ere on the ridge overlooking the lake and then when we got
down to the tori by the lake the sun was getting low in the sky and
mirrored on the lake. From there we walked back to the car on the road,
but that was still by the lake. With the low angle the sun in the sky
the illumination was constantly changing and that was nice too. The sun
was almost down at this point and the wind was strong. It was becoming
much colder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">Unfortunately Tadashi's car we broken into: the window next to the
driver was all over the seat and floor. While the bags of onsen things
in the car were gone through there was nothing worth taking. Our car was
not at all a good choice for this. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times">We went to a service station and the attendants were very thoughtful and
found some almost-clear plastic and tape. This mad e huge difference to
our body temperatures and we went to an onsen and then restaurant. I had
never been to an onsen of this scale; like a factory for the washing and
soaking of human bodies.  Anyway, it was nice. </FONT></P>

			organized this walk to Izu and there were so many unexpected 
			accidents this time. </font>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">On the first day, we were 
			planning to climb Mt.Manjiro and Mansaburou-dake, but it started 
			snowing as we neared the top by cars; and when we reached the top, 
			the snow was covering the road and we had to give up the peaks.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Instead we climbed lower 
			Mt.Amagi, one of the best 100 mountains in Japan. Although the trail 
			leading to the top turned out to be an asphalt covered road except 
			the last 500m, people enjoyed the easygoing walk. Funny thing is, 
			the road was marked as a hiking trail on the map. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">At around the dinner time the 
			organizer (me) started feeling nausea and threw up three times 
			during the night. I had to assign Shibuya-san to lead the second-day 
			seaside walk and I had to rest at the youth hostel. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">When they got to the seaside 
			trail, the trail turned out to be blocked by a landslide and they 
			could &nbsp;enjoy&nbsp; only the first part of the trail. When they were 
			having rest at flat rock formation on the seaside, very strong wind 
			was constantly attacking them. The good news is, at least they could 
			enjoy onsen on both days. </font></div>

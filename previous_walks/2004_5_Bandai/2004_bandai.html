<div>
	<div>
		<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Because it was a car based trip and 3 drivers signed up for the hike we
		could able to accommodate only 13 participants. We are really sorry that
		some of the interested people were not able to join this hike.
		We started from the usual 7/11 at 6:02 am and could reach Seinenoi
		at 9:30. am. The beginning of the hike was relaxed ; we started
		climbing up Bandai from Urbandai ski slope. Because the mountain was
		officially closed to public, trails were bit wild and 
		thrilling.
		After about an hour's climb, we reached the marshland covered with snow. 
		It
		was nice to walk through unstable layers of the snow paths. The weather 
		was
		extremely perfect and the views from the trails were splendid. View of 
		the
		Bandai-summit in the mirror pond and the Aonuma from the trails are some
		examples.&nbsp; We had lunch at the Bandai-summit and descended through the 
		steep
		sulphur trails, some time it was surprising to see the flat landscape
		surrounded with red and yellow volcanic rocks like we have reached in 
		some
		other planet. After the hike we soaked ourselves in Kawakami onsen 
		for a
		while and headed to the youth hostel where we stayed. After dinner 
		we
		enjoyed the guitar performance and Russian music by Victoria and 
		friends.
		Second day we visited the visitor center, where we learned about the
		geography of Bandai-san and after that we walked around the five color
		ponds. At 1.30 pm we enjoyed the BBQ near the lakeside. Our BBQ host was 
		so
		kind to us that we were able to&nbsp; taste all the leaves and plants in 
		that
		region (Ooieshi!! Ne!!). We thank all the participants for their kind
		cooperation in the hike.</font></div>

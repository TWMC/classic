<P>Just wanted to tell you a bit about the trip...</P>

<P>Akira, Jan and me took the 5:29 train from Hitachinoushiku
and<BR>
arrived in Ikebukuro at 6:39. About two minutes later Masumi called<BR>
from home to tell us that she had overslept. (I think somebody
is<BR>
building a reputation here !) So instead of the 6:50 express train<BR>
we took the one at 7:30 which was not really so bad, only that<BR>
instead of having direct connections at Seibu-Chichibu and<BR>
Mitsumineguchi we now had to wait more than half an hour at each<BR>
station. We had a nice chance to watch the swallows feeding their<BR>
offspring at Mitsumineguchi Eki, though. (Pictures !)</P>

<P>The non-ropeway option was pretty much out of the question<BR>
at this time, after the ascent and a quick visit to the shrine<BR>
it was about 11:20 before we finally got going, quite late<BR>
considering we had got up at four. After the heavy rain on<BR>
Friday and on early Saturday morning, it stopped raining around<BR>
9am just as predicted. For a moment at least. Luckily the rain<BR>
was only rather light during our ascent to the hut, but the trails<BR>
were pretty muddy. The highlight of the first day definitely were<BR>
the deer on Shiwairayama. They came extremely close and virtually<BR>
let themselves be hand-fed. Masumi and one of the deer only got
to<BR>
about two metres of each other, then the deer twiched a bit, Masumi<BR>
twitched a bit more and they leapt away from each other.<BR>
The pictures of the deer were not taken with a zoom lens, by the
way.</P>

<P>We reached Kumotoriyama Sensou just before 5pm after a leisurely<BR>
(read: all four of us were pretty unfit) walk just under map time,<BR>
looking a bit as if we had taken part in a mud wrestling competition.<BR>
In the evening we played the German board game 'Die Siedler von<BR>
Catan' that Jan had carried up the mountain while drinking the<BR>
beer we had made Masumi pay for making us wait in the station.</P>

<P>The next morning we climbed the final 30 minutes to Kumotoriyama<BR>
that defied its name: although there was a solid cloud cover<BR>
below 1800 meters, the summit of Kumotoriyama was sunny and we<BR>
had a beautiful view of still snow-covered Fujisan.<BR>
The descent was a bit depressing as we dove back into the clouds<BR>
rather soon and stayed there for the rest of the trip. (Remind<BR>
me to discuss his definition of 'basically just downhill' with
Paul<BR>
on Wednesday !)</P>

<P>We got slightly worried when some people that we talked to
on the<BR>
summit told us that it had taken them about 13 hours to walk<BR>
from the Kumotoriyama hut to Okutama Eki, the map time was only<BR>
about seven hours and we had planned to make it in that time.
In<BR>
the end it took us slightly under eight hours including some<BR>
generous breaks, so those people must have done something seriously<BR>
wrong. There was light rain again a large part of the way down
from<BR>
Kumotoriyama, especially on the final mudslide down the ridge.
When<BR>
we had finally reached the road leading to Okutama we heard a<BR>
thunderstorm close by, but we made it into the onsen before the<BR>
downpour started. (The guys actually had to wait for half an hour<BR>
before getting in because it was so crowded.)</P>

<P>We ended the trip with a nice dinner in an Italian restaurant
in<BR>
Shinjuku (I am still surprised they let me in with my mud-crusted<BR>
hiking pants). I am not sure whether we successfully scared Paul<BR>
into believing that we got lost (&quot;Paul ! Paul ! It's getting
dark<BR>
and we lost the way ! Do you know the number of the mountain rescue
?!&quot;).<BR>
probably the guy singing &quot;O sole mio&quot; was too loud.<BR>

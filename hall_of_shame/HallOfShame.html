Bjoern was a Mac geek with which he designed current TWMC HP as a "ruthlessly efficient" secretary, and of course Iulia was always competing with Bjoern's Mac with her cheerful talk and sexy legs!

Hall of Shame - Injuries</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Luckily, there were no
serious injuries yet on TWMC trips. In fact, only 3 are worth
mentioning.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Paul popped his knee on
the Oze trip of 1998, and he promised to provide MRI scans of
his knee for this page many years ago ...</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Then there is Bj&ouml;rns
fall on the <A HREF="../previous_walks/2001_02_Skiing/DownhillSkiing2001.html">2001
downhill skiing trip</A>. He managed to fall on the easiest part
of <BR>
the easiest slope of the Alts resort on Bandai-san, where in fact
the only difficulty is not to stop.<BR>
It was said that he was looking at some cute Japanese girls but
this account was denied by Bj&ouml;rn. It is <BR>
undeniable, however, that he had a second fall at the very same
place a few descents later when a really <BR>
cute snowboarding girl bumped into him from behind.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Be this as it may, below
is an MRI scan of his right upper arm, a vertical slice from the
front (left) to the back (right). <BR>
After some confusion (the doctors initially scared Bj&ouml;rn
shitless by diagnosing he had torn his rotator cuff) it <BR>
turned out that the arm was &quot;only&quot; broken after all,
though in a somewhat awkward way. You can see that <BR>
a chunk broke out off the upper arm bone opposite to the joint
with the shoulder. The white blob in the <BR>
centre of the image is the bone, the broken out piece is visible
to the upper left of it.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Also note the interesting
back translation of Bj&ouml;rns name from Katakana into Romaji.
<BR>
Klotz Bj&ouml;rn became Kurotutu Biyorun.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Finally there is Stefans
knee injury at the <A HREF="../previous_walks/2001_07_Kamikochi/Kamikochi2001.html">2001
Kamikochi</A> trip. The MRI scan below doesn't really show anything,
but he had to be flown out by helicopter!</FONT></CENTER></P>

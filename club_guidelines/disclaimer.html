<P>We would like you to become aware of the safety issues while

walking / mountaineering with the TWMC, as all outdoor activities

have some element of risk. Following the Great East Japan Earthquake of March
11, 2011, it is especially important to be aware of the currently heightened
danger of aftershocks and landslides, as well as the risk of radioactive
contamination as a result of the damage incurred by the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear reactor. Of course we shall not be going to <st1:City w:st="on">
<st1:place w:st="on">
Fukushima</st1:place>
</st1:City>
 or Tohoku, and we are also avoiding the riskier high mountain walks, but it is
not possible to eliminate all risk. For this reason, this year we are requiring
anyone joining our mountain walks to take out <font color="#FF0000">personal
insurance inclusive of helicopter rescue</font> - we can suggest insurance
schemes that we know about, but it is your responsibility to ensure that you are
suitably covered. Due to problems with legal requirements

and responsibilities, it is essential that you agree to sign the

disclaimer of the TWMC that <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">ALL RISKS ARE

TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL NOT THE CLUB</FONT>. We will ask you to

sign a document on your first walk with the TWMC (which also includes

the date, address, full print of name, accident contact person,

etc..) which states that you understand that you may encounter

some risks while walking with the TWMC and that you shall try

your best to be prepared for such circumstances. The text from

this document is shown below.</P>



<P>&nbsp;</P>



<P>We are always very happy to assist you in preparing for the

risks involved during walking. If you do not agree to sign the

document, then please refrain from joining our activities until

contacting and consulting a current committee member. In all cases,

the TWMC is here to attempt to help you have a great time in the

outdoors, but we cannot be responsible for your safety - this

responsibility can only be yours and yours alone. Please be sensible

and use your common sense to maximize your safety during any trip.</P>



<P>Similarly, all equipment either owned by the TWMC or other

persons must be used at the individual persons own risk on club

and/or private walks. Any equipment damaged or lost must be replaced

in full or paid for in full to the owner(s).</P>
